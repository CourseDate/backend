    "overview": "Studies in Organizational Change is an advanced course in the Learning & Organizational Change major designed to introduce students to key constructs and ideas about change in organizations. The class is organized as follows: We will begin with a discussion of the notion of change in general and organizational change in particular. We will identify four levels of analysis that scholars who study organizational change focus on - individual, group, organization, and institution. We will then examine different levers or resources for organizational change including - routines, culture, leadership, social capital, identity and institutional environments. We will conclude by considering how these resources interact with aspects of the organization such as time and developmental stage. Throughout the class, students will be expected to constantly apply the constructs and ideas to particular cases of organizational change.",

The class utilizes two texts (Peter Senge's FIFTH DISCIPLINE and Margaret Wheatley's LEADERSHIP AND THE NEW SCIENCE).  Each class session has a brief lecture, experiential exercise(s) and an opportunity for small group discussions.  Learning teams are formed based on common learning goals established the first class session, with interactive presentations to the class.  Graded assignments include a mid-term, final exam and three 2-page Learning Briefs that test students' ability to translate the key concepts introduced in class into real world applications.  The information and learning is transferrable across professional careers and personal lives.",

Fundamental to the course is developing the ability to cultivate an awareness of one's own cognitive framework and analytic lens and to try and understand the ways in which who we are shape the ways in which we see (or don't see) things and how we interpret and make meaning out of the world around us.  We will think deeply about the processes involved in the construction of knowledge, what it means to \"know\" something, and the ethical and moral questions inherent in the production and consumption of knowledge.  During the quarter you will learn about the theoretical foundations of observation and interview-based data collection and analysis.  In addition, you will gain exposure to examples of what these types of research look like in their finished form - once they have been completed, written up, and accepted for publication in peer-reviewed journals and books. Lastly, this course will provide you with the opportunity to apply each of the methods we cover to conduct a small-scale group research project on a topic of your choosing.  The course content includes research question formation, qualitative research design, linking primary data to existing theory and empirical research, developing and investigating hypotheses and theories in a qualitative research context, observation and interview-based research methods, analyzing and interpreting qualitative data, and learning how to use qualitative data to construct and further an evidence-based argument.\nPre-Req: Must have completed practicum planning form.",

Issues of technology, assessment, and classroom management will be explored.   At the heart of the course will be how best to teach students of different ability levels \"communicative competence\" in the target language through the interpersonal, interpretive and presentational modes.\n  \nModeling and reading will be the basis for lesson plans students will create and present to the class.   The observation experience, prior classroom experiences, textbook readings and selected articles will form the basis for weekly discussions.  Students will use their ongoing field observations to examine the ideas discussed.  A cumulative final project will entail planning a unit for future use.  The unit will be included in the student's digital portfolio. Students will be given copies of many proven activities and connect their lessons to state and national standards on world language acquisition.

From persistent inequalities in housing and education to gleaming edifices of financial success, these \"tale of two cities\" twins have much in common.   South Africa has made progress since the fall of racial apartheid in 1994, but there is much work still to be done. The multiracial \"Rainbow Nation,\" is a young democracy with a constitution considered one of the most progressive in the world. But many of the rights promised have yet to be fulfilled for Johannesburg's 4.4 million people.  These gaps provide ample material on which to report. We will arrive during a national election year - only the sixth time that blacks in South Africa have had the right to vote. Your trip will begin with briefings with experts, visits to the Apartheid Museum and other attractions, and tours - from the fashionable Sandton, \"Africa's richest square mile,\" to the famous Soweto, a key site in the struggle against apartheid. You will report in teams on various media platforms on the following tentative topics: 1) Tech Entrepreneurship, 2) South African Elections and Youth Voters, 3) South Africa's Women's Movement and 4) China in South Africa. \n\n  \n\nIn this program, you will:  \n\nDevelop a global view of the urbanization and human rights issues facing major cities \n\nBetter understand, through the lens of South Africa, the forces shaping the developing continent, including technology, age, gender and immigration issues. \n\nLearn interviewing and reporting strategies in a foreign country \n\nProduce a reporting project that, it is hoped, will be published after the trip",

By learning about past cultures, what made them different and what made them similar, we gain a better understanding of human history and the state of the world today. People in the past were very different, but they shared one thing in common -- they left behind stones and bones, pottery fragments, great monuments and burial offerings. These fragments of the past are used by archaeologists to build an understanding of what it means to be human. In this class, you will be introduced to the questions, theories, and methods of archaeology. You will learn about how archaeologists locate, survey and excavate the great monuments of the past; how they study artifacts in the lab; and how they use the stuff they find to piece together stories about the past, and test those stories against the evidence. You will learn about the diversity of ancient and modern peoples, their cultures, and the past they inhabited.

    "overview": "The goal of sociocultural anthropology, the largest subfield of anthropology and the core of the discipline, is to understand the dynamics of human variation in social action and cultural thought. A key question is how these variations are produced and reproduced, whether we speak of society (subsistence, ideas) or individuals (biology, psychology, social identity). Conversely, what happens when reproduction fails to occur, or does so when and how it should not. Because reproduction is so strongly associated with biology in our society, viewing it through a cultural lens poses significant challenges to some of our most basic tenets. Tensions arise in questions of agency vs. control, nature vs. culture, identity construction, reproducing under varying conditions, and so on. The study of reproduction, therefore, offers a window into the heart of anthropology itself. The goals of this course are (1) to expose students to just a few of the many sociocultural approaches to reproduction by ranging broadly across topics, time, and place; and (2) to identify and evaluate concepts and theories embedded in writings on the dynamics of reproduction. While the concept of \"reproduction\" can refer to societal reproduction, emphasis will be on the reproduction of children. To this end, possible topics may include fostering/adoption, AIDS orphans, fatherhood, technologies of fertility control, assisted reproduction, obstetrics, gender imbalances in Asia, debates over abortion, etc.",

Through film, literature and other expository writings, this seminar will explore the various ways in which notions of class, gender, race, sexuality and other identities are socially constructed performances.  Performance covers various modes of human communicationfrom how we use language to storytelling to cultural rituals.  Some of the questions we will consider in this seminar are:  how do various identities relate to one another or do they?  What are some of the ways in which we perform versions of ourselves daily based on the expectations of those around us?  Finally, when are these social constructions of identity fluid, interchangeable, temporary or permanent?",

The decade of the 1960s will be the major focus of the course, as we trace the achievements of the southern civil rights struggle, the turn toward Black Power and the rise of new issues, leaders, voices, challenges and struggles. We close with an examination of Dr. King's quest for economic and human rights, African American participation in the anti-Vietnam war movement and the rise of African American women's leadership in struggles for socio-economic justice and gender equality.  In light of the high quality and breadth of documentary footage of the movement, we will integrate segments of many films in class.

Second, we examine race in combination with the cross-cutting axes of class, gender, sexuality, region, and religion. Finally, the third part of the course focuses on the ramifications of racial classification and identity in law, economics, education, and social movements.

    "overview": "This course is designed to introduce you to the history and art of the book, particularly in the Western world, and particularly in the early modern period. As I approach it, this course has three separate, but inter-related, emphases or themes. The first is about seeing the book as a physical artifact - how to look at a book as a biblio-archaeologist would. To do this you will learn to uncover information about the nature, purpose, and implications of a book's material features: its type, paper, printing, illustration, and binding. \n\nThe second theme is the impact of the book on European society. That is, the book not only as a commercial commodity and as the primary vehicle for the transmission of ideas but also as an expression of the mentalit, or mind-set, of all those who came in contact with it: author, printer, publisher, seller, binder, illustrator, reader, and censor. \n\nAnd the third theme that will weave through our investigations is the mutability and transience of the text, the sometimes fragile and tenuous transmission of a work from edition to edition, century to century, civilization to civilization. In exploring this theme we will be mainly concerned with the question of how the physical form of a book affects the way a text is understood and disseminated. \n\nOver the course of the semester you will have the advantage of being able to work with many \"real\" examples of manuscripts and printed books from the McCormick Library of Special Collections in order to learn the basic taxonomy of the book, that is, to be able to identify and name its parts. You will also develop the ability to ascertain what these physical objects can tell us about their creators' varied intentions and anticipated audiences. You will be able to do this simply by virtue of what you discover by examining them attentively, quite apart what you learn by reading them. In other words, books are \"primary sources\" from several points of view, and you should finish the semester more aware of how many different kinds of things books can tell us.",

We will analyze art in light of a constellation of explanatory factors (\"causes\"): personal, aesthetic, technical, gender, social, ethnic, political, economic, and institutional. The primary focus will be the foremost vanguards (avant-gardes) of the era, individuals and groups who contested norms and authorities, but we will also consider competing forms of visual culture. Because of the cultural authority of Paris in these years, French art and architecture will claim most of our time, but we will consider the entanglements of France with other cultures and nations. At the center of the course will be discussions of Realism (Gustave Courbet), douard Manet, Impressionism (Cassatt, Morisot, Manet, Renoir, Pissarro, Caillebotte and others), and \"Post-Impressionism\" (Van Gogh, Seurat, Gauguin, Czanne). A central question will be: why is Impressionism so beloved today?

Widely recognized as aniconic phenomenaboth in antiquity and in cross-cultural perspectiveare built monuments, such as pillars and steles, and natural formations, such as uncarved stones. In ancient Near Eastern studies, aniconism has traditionally been examined within the context of biblical texts prohibiting the making of cult images, or \"idols,\" and has played a significant role in analyzing artistic and religious practices in early Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In recent decades, aniconism has attracted fresh attention among scholars engaged with a wide range of historical periods and geographical regions, with significant results. These investigations have newly emphasized how nineteenth-century scholarship profoundly shaped subsequent studies, promoting the idea of an \"aniconic age\" that was widely adopted by scholars of ancient Greece, the Near East, and early Buddhism.\nDrawing on innovative approaches introduced from anthropology, religious studies, art history, and media studies, and new investigations of ancient written sources, this course explores current directions in the study of aniconism within multiple cultural spheres: ancient Greece, Egypt, the Near East, and the early Islamic world. What does \"aniconic\" embrace, and how do we demarcate it from other representational modes? What are the advantages and limitations of cross-cultural comparison? Topics include analysis of key concepts such as image, representation, figuration, and abstraction; the coexistence of aniconic and figural approaches to representing the divine; the agency and efficacy of material and scale; aniconism and the spiritual experience of vision; comparative approaches to classification; and aniconism and the natural environment.",

    "overview": "This research seminar examines the relationship between architecture, resources, and territory in 20th century modernization projects in Latin America, the Middle East, South East Asia, and Africa. We will explore the conditions in which architecture has become a tool of development (a concept which we will address critically), and the functions it assumed in the ordering and managing of labor, natural resources and industry. While modernization projects are usually considered in terms of engineering and large-scale infrastructure, the architectural lens will offer a tool for a nuanced social-cultural analysis of the epistemological assumptions and value systems that undergird these projects. We will examine the role architecture played in the consolidation of \"development thinking\" in the shift from late colonial projects to the Cold War, specifically in reformulating the colonial relations between resource extraction and production, and the new emphasis placed on the maintaining of the \"smallness\" of small scale societies in terms of village habitation and vernacular forms of production.",

Work will be done in a two-dimensional format using oil paint on a gesso-prepared ground on a canvas support. The focus is on acquiring the basic material and technical skills necessary to articulate visual ideas in oil paint, including how to organize compositions using color and value relationships, form and shape, placement and paint application. Although most exercises deal with problems in painting, considerable work in drawing may be required to support studies in the use of color and paint. Assignments may introduce students to a variety of subject matter, such as still life, landscape, and the figure in representational and abstract form. Instruction is individualized and students and faculty participate in one-on-one discussions of works in progress. Students also participate in class discussions and critiques to develop the criteria for making their own judgments about works of visual art. Evaluation is based on the degree of growth, attendance, participation, and the degree of mastery of painting materials and techniques. No prerequisites. P/N permitted.",

Emerging paradigms will be examined, such as the superceding of images by information, and of art exhibition by communication and media platforming. We will consider some of the different ways that artists handle information and new media and technology, for example how they have appropriated relatively new forms like networks and databases. The social and technological changes associated with globalization and the artistic responses to such changes will lead us to track shifts in art's relationship to audiences and culture at large, and to question the relevance today of distinctions between high and low, margin and mainstream. With these developments as our framework, we will then review and update notions of modernism and postmodernism in the visual arts, and question the status today of more traditional media like painting and sculpture, as well as re-evaluate the idea of the avant-garde and its long-held desire to merge art and life.  \n\nNo prerequisites.

Evolution occurs when mutation introduces new alleles that replace existing alleles in populations via one of two mechanisms. Replacement can occur by chance (genetic drift) or by encoding a superior phenotype (natural selection). Natural selection produces one of the major features of the living world, adaptation. We will model these processes for single-locus traits, DNA sequences, and phenotypic traits. When populations are separated from one another geographically, they inevitably take different evolutionary paths; it is in this manner that most species are formed. These latter processes-change within lineages and diversification among lineages-have been iterated over staggeringly long periods of time, producing another major feature of the living world, its breathtaking biodiversity. We will familiarize ourselves with the history and diversity of life on earth by examination of the fossil record, and by inferring relationships among species using phylogenetic methods.",

From a materials science perspective, the class will examine how metal ore was processed and cast, evident in characteristic microstructures. The resulting data will be used as a basis for understanding the vast trading network associated with metal production and the importance of metallurgy to the Roman economy. As this class will be offered in the McCormick School of Engineering as well as the Weinberg School of Arts and Sciences, we expect equal enrollment from Engineering and Humanities students. Following several weeks of joint instruction, the students will be grouped into teams to undertake and present various aspects and theories of historical and scientific research into Roman metal production.",

    "overview": "Global Cinema: The Many Labyrinths of Identity\n\nFrom the Middle East to Europe and now to the United States, today's world is once again haunted by a violent resurgence of the nativist discourses of identity. The flames of sectarian wars have engulfed the Middle East; the borders that the European Union promised to dissolve are reappearing; and white nationalists are marching in the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia. What is identity? How do we form an identity? How do we liberate ourselves from the violence of an exclusionary identity? How do cinema and literature represent and complicate our ideas of identity? This seminar explores how a critical practice of engaging with global cinema, alongside reading literary texts, challenges our understanding of identity. We will closely analyze a wide range of films from the past century about the paradoxes and complexities of individual and collective identities. \"Identity\" is never straightforward and watching/reading for it in cinema and literature requires entering different forms of labyrinth. The focus of our seminar will be on how memory, trauma, and language relate to various formations of (gender, national, colonial, etc.) identities in literature and cinema. We will also examine the ways through which different forms of literary and cinematic relations and communications problematize the identity of these works. Our attempt will be to approach cinema and literature as a way of making worlds and crossing between them. Students are required to write a research paper by the end of the quarter.",

Films like Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita (1960) and actors like Marcello Mastroianni have not only defined a crucial moment in the history of cinema but have also entered our larger cultural imaginary. In this new course format, we will begin by screening a number of contemporary films (including the 2014 Academy Award winning The Great Beauty) and then identify their precursors and sources of inspiration by going back to the heyday of Neorealism in the 1940s (Rossellini, De Sica, Visconti) and the remarkable output of the 1960s and 1970s (Fellini, Antonioni, Pasolini, Bertolucci).

    "overview": "This course has the following main aims. It introduces key ideas from some of the leading political philosophical traditions such as: social contract tradition, liberalism, republicanism, socialism/Marxism and critical theory. It considers the role of gender and sexuality in these traditions. A historical focus is given to major texts by past women philosophers and political theorists from the 18th to the 20th C, whose reflections on sex, gender and women's rights are also considered classics of political philosophy: this section includes writings by Mary Wollstonecraft, John Stuart Mill, Harriet Taylor, Simone de Beauvoir, and Carole Pateman. A fourth focal point of the course asks how equal rights claims were historically formulated by \"those who had no rights\". Here students draw on their own critical resources to assess the rhetorical and philosophical strategies of some of the most famous rights claims. Critical focus is given, for example, to the tradition of using analogy to justify rights claims. Thus students will have the opportunity to critical evaluate rights claims based on analogies to animals, slavery, children, and to consider possible alternatives. Texts by white feminists who compared their condition to slavery are discussed in tandem with texts by philosophers of color who have challenged such analogies. A further section of the course which gives a focus to paradoxes and inconsistencies which have arisen in the history of rights claims discourse allows student to develop their skills in textual interpretation. A comparative approach is also taken to different rights claims. The class asks: What are the most imperative rights claims formulated by those who had no rights? What should those who seek equal rights actually claim? How has the perception of these imperatives transformed over time? How do the intersecting perspectives of gender, sexuality, race, and class change these imperatives? Finally, the course also gives attention to the role of gender and sexuality in contemporary political theory, focussing on debates about justice and the family, pornography, prostitution, surrogacy contracts, the 'politics of the veil' in the public sphere, multiculturalism, and challenges from contemporary theorists whose work is based in the resources of intersectionality theory, critical race theory, and queer theory. A final section on contemporary debates and figures in feminist political philosophy, includes excepts by contemporary philosophers and political thinkers such as Susan Moller Okin, Carole Pateman, Joan Scott and Judith Butler.",

The second section of the course considers the role of Foucauldian biopolitics within a number of debates from contemporary gender, queer and race studies. Topics will be selected from: politics of utopianism, futurism, the anti-social thesis, critique of reproductive futurism, necropolitics and afro-pessimism, cruel optimism, social ontology and precarious life, debility, biopolitics and the management of language, and the politics of plural temporalities.",

However, economic theories tell us what are important determinants of long run growth and development performances. More specifically, we will discuss the roles of investment (i.e., physical capital accumulation), of education (i.e., human capital accumulation), of technological change (i.e., knowledge capital accumulation through innovation and R&D), of income distribution, of population growth and demographic change, and others.",

    "overview": "This course will strive to employ economic analysis in order to provide a coherent theory of the law. The economic approach to law assumes that punishments such as incarceration or fines are implicit prices for violating the law. According to this view, these prices may be chosen in such a way that will yield the most socially desirable outcome. Of course, it may not be appropriate to judge laws entirely based on their economic efficiency. For example, it may also be appropriate to consider outcomes that are \"fair\" or \"just,\" however defined, and these outcomes may not be the most efficient. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that efficiency is one important criterion for purposes of judging the law. Given that economists are often interested in studying incentives, it is therefore quite natural that we might be both interested and perhaps even well-equipped to analyze various areas of the law. Along these lines, we will seek to employ simple economic models in order to understand the efficiency of laws in several areas, including torts, contracts, and property. In studying these diverse areas of the law, the economic approach to understanding the law will be consistent throughout, and will allow us to study these different areas of the law in a unified manner.",

How do imaginative representations of surveillance technologies and voyeuristic pursuits urge us to reconsider the gender politics of \"looking,\" the boundaries between private and public spheres, and the relations between individuals and broader communities? How do we--as Twitterers, Snapchatters, and Instagrammers--normalize and internalize surveillance?

In addition to gaining a general familiarity with some of the most influential texts of English literature, we will be especially interested in discovering how literary texts construct, engage in, and transform political discourse. What kinds of political intervention are literary texts capable of making? What are the political implications of particular rhetorical strategies and generic choices? How do literary texts encode or allegorize particular political questions? How, at a particular historical moment, does it become possible to ignore or overlook the political projects embedded in these texts? In readings of Chaucer, More, Sidney, Shakespeare, Milton, Behn, and Swift, among others, we will consider how important it is to understand these texts from a political perspective, and wonder why this perspective is so often ignored in favor of psychologizing and subjectivizing readings.",

We will think about Shakespeare's contexts and how they matter: a theatre on the outskirts of ever-expanding Renaissance London; a financially successful acting company in which he played the simultaneous and often overlapping roles of writer, actor, and co-owner; a world of reading and writing in which words, plots, and texts were constantly being re-circulated into new plays; the rich possibilities of the English language around 1600. We will centrally consider the ways in which these theatrical, literary, and cultural questions register within the plays themselves. What do words, plays, stories dohow do they workin Shakespeare's plays? Who or what is an audience or an actor in these plays? How do Shakespeare's plays stage issues such as gender, race, religion, sexuality, social class, entertainment and the media -- and how does his approach to these issues continue to speak to our own era?",

Focusing on a selection of imaginative writings, including origin stories, poems, novels, and a slave narrative, we shall seek to identify and understand the significance of the terrorsof the dark other, the body, nature, sex, mixture, blood violence, totalitarian power, and apocalypsethat haunt and spook the origins and development of American literature. Students will be encouraged to draw connections between past American fantasies and fears and contemporary popular culture and politics, from classic American films like Hitchcock's Psycho to the television series Game of Thrones, from American blues and jazz to the rap lyrics of Jay-Z's \"99 Problems,\" from the Red Scare and the Cold War to the contemporary war on terror.",

Foodways, or the eating habits and culinary practices of a people, region, or historical period, are a powerful lens through which to explore eaters' national and cultural identities and reveal social inequities. How does what you eat reveal who you are in American life? Beginning with early American Indian cuisine and Mary Rowlandson's The Sovereignty and Goodness of God, we will investigate how the \"nation\" was contested through depictions of food in literature. What kinds of food and eating habits were depicted as \"savage\"? How \"civilized\" is the sentimental myth of the First Thanksgiving, memorialized in Lydia Maria Child's popular poem, \"Over the River and Through the Wood\"? Travelling through the 19th century, we will examine how foodways define gender, race, and citizenship in the American republic. How can studying nineteenth-century foodways help us to understand who does (and who doesn't) belong to the nation? Finally, we will arrive in the 20th- and 21st-century to focus on how contemporary writers of color take up foodways to deconstruct dominant national narratives. What can our current foodie moment teach us about how eaters perceive of their national identities today?",

These double names can be traced back to 1066, when the French-speaking Normans, led by William the Bastard, conquered England and installed their countrymen in positions of power. In the aftermath of this victory, William the Bastard became William the Conqueror and cows and pigs and sheep became beef and pork and mutton - at least when they were served up to the Normans at their banquets. Like many other words associated with aristocratic life, these terms all derive from French. In this course we will investigate this and many other milestones in the history of the English language, focusing on the period from the early middle ages through the eighteenth century. We will pay particular attention to the relationships among \"high\" and \"low\" forms of language, including efforts to elevate the status of English and the dynamics of self-consciously \"low\" registers of language such as slang and obscenity. In addition to offering an introduction to the linguistic, literary, and social history of England, this course will help you to develop a more sensitive understanding of modern English that you can bring to other classes and to life in general.",

    "overview": "Fabulous Fictions is a writing class that focuses on writing that departs from realism. Often the subject matter of such writing explores states of mind that are referred to as non-ordinary reality. A wide variety of genres and subgenres fall under this heading: fabulism, myth, fairy tales, fantasy, science fiction, speculative fiction, horror, the grotesque, the supernatural, surrealism, etc. Obviously, in a mere quarter we could not hope to study each of these categories in the kind of detail that might be found in a literature class. The aim in 307 is to discern and employ writing techniques that overarch these various genres, to study the subject through doing--by writing your own fabulist stories. We will read examples of fabulism as writers read: to understand how these fictions are made--studying them from the inside out, so to speak. Many of these genres overlap. For instance, they are all rooted in the tale, a kind of story that goes back to primitive sources. They all speculate: they ask the question What If? They all are stories that demand invention, which, along with the word transformation, will be the key terms in the course. The invention might be a monster, a method of time travel, an alien world, etc., but with rare exception the story will demand an invention and that invention will often also be the central image of the story. So, in discussing how these stories work we will also be learning some of the most basic, primitive moves in storytelling. To get you going I will be bringing in exercises that employ fabulist techniques and hopefully will promote stories. These time tested techniques will be your entrances--your rabbit holes and magic doorways--into the figurative. You will be asked to keep a dream journal, which will serve as basis for one of the exercises. Besides the exercises, two full-length stories will be required, as well as written critiques of one another's work.  Because we all serve to make up an audience for the writer, attendance is mandatory.",

We will learn to describe the forms and rhythms of particular works by major and emerging poets, such as Rosa Alcal, Daniel Borzutzky, Fred Moten, Allison Hedge Coke, and Claudia Rankine. We will also emphasize the study of organizations and journals in creating poetic community. This course is organized in conjunction with two major events at Northwestern: the digital reissue of the poetry magazines Mandorla: New Writing from the Americas (1991-2013), and XCP: Cross Cultural Poetics (1997-2015), and two 1-day conferences devoted to their legacies. The class will therefore include the opportunity to attend readings and conference workshops, to meet with a wide variety of contemporary poets, translators, and editors associated with the magazines, including Roberto Tejada, Kristin Dykstra, and Mark Nowak, and to work on digital exhibitions appraising their work and its legacies.

In both visual media and the novel, suspicion can directly fuel aesthetic engagementafter all, a cautious reader is a close reader. In this class, we will examine what conniving, naive, shrewd, or deranged narrative voices ask of readers in texts from Henry James, Herman Melville, Nabokov, Jenny Holzer, and Danzy Senna. One goal of this class will be to address the historical contexts of marginalization in the social spherein terms of gender, race, sexuality, age, and disabilityto ask how suspicious reading affects our social life.",

    "overview": "When your high-school English teacher praised \"rounded\" literary characters at the expense of \"flat\" ones, he or she was prising the novelistic over the allegorical, representing the latter as at best a sign of authorial laziness and at worst a vehicle for the heavy-handed transmission of doctrine. This course will approach allegory differently, considering it as a tool for thought. After an introductory unit that examines a number of competing definitions of allegory, we will read (and view) a variety of speculative fictions, pairing the medieval with the modern in order to highlight commonalities as well as differences. In order to explore the conventions of allegorical battle, we will thus read Prudentius' fifth-century Psychomachia, which recounts a series of gruesome battles between personified Virtues and Vices, in conjunction with selected episodes from Joss Whedon's teen-focused television series, Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Within the category of allegorical journey, we will consider early episodes of Star Trek alongside the fourteenth-century \"best-seller\" Piers Plowman, and the medieval morality play Everyman alongside the classic 1957 western The 3:10 to Yuma. In engaging with these works, we will ask ourselves how their personifications are \"good to think with.\" What kinds of work do they do that mimetic characters do not? In what ways are they more or less \"real\" than the fictive persons and authorial personae with whom they interact? Finally, is personification itself a relatively homogenous category, or can we distinguish important subtypes? What different reading practices might these subtypes allow or encourage?",

Why did people serving in the court of Queen Elizabeth become obsessed with writing sonnets about frustrated desire? How did poets link tortuous love with other experiences-- the torment of writer's block, disappointments of ambition, anguish of religious doubt, or simple fear of not being in control?  How did love and sex become hopelessly entangled with politics, religion, race, nationalism, and gender? When did love poetry cement the status quo, and when was eros an unruly force that seemed to unravel the very fabric of the self or the community? We'll tackle these questions by reading amazing poems by Shakespeare, Sidney, Donne, Marvell, Wroth, as well as some recently discovered \"new\" voices. We will dive into topics such as  early modern religion, politics, colonialism, science, same-sex desire, medical theory, portraits, gender theory, and the natural world; and perhaps include a trip to the Chicago Shakespeare Theater.",

The role of translation (inter-lingual and cultural) in the depiction of race will be central to our discussions. We will read texts originally written in Arabic, English, French, and Portuguese and indigenous African languages to examine how writers come to terms with the idea of race. Who is an African and who is not? Is race biological or socially constructed? How are non-black races (e.g. Arabs, white, Indians etc.) represented in African writing? How is the \"black\" in Africa different or similar to \"black\" in other parts of the world? How do \"black aesthetics\" and \"black arts\" in Africa differ from similar concepts in black-diaspora cultures? How does racism intersect with other forms of oppression in African societies? How are internal racisms represented in African contexts? How are representations of race in canonical writing (e.g., Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice) treated in African translations and allusions to those texts? Performing both distant and close readings of African writers, we will read primary texts in terms of the techniques individual artists use to treat race matters.

In fact, however, the problems of remembering the Civil Warobscuring slavery as a cause, overly glorifying the antebellum South, or smoothing over postwar difficultieshave been present in the American imagination since the last shot was fired. This course will analyze literature that confronts both the necessity and the shortfalls of American memory, exploring texts that struggle to remember (or forget) the Civil War. Why, for instance, is the Civil War such a glaring absence in Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn? Is this absence a willful forgetfulness of the war's horror, or is it a complex confrontation with the problems of national memory? And in what ways do these problems comment upon American conceptions of race? Why, for example, did Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind skew the cultural memory of Civil-War-era whiteness more than any other text of the twentieth century? By studying these works and more, students will learn that (mis)remembering the Civil War is a problem that extends beyond the conspicuous statues of Confederate figures.

As an entry into thinking about how to \"make knowledge,\" we will perform experiments on how the religious, elegiac, personal, and scientific poems of a little known writer named Hester Pulter offers an occasion for thinking about how poetry enters a canon (that is we will discuss methodological debates surrounding editing, digitalization and anthologization). Experiments might include: contextualizing a group of poems (by various authors) in an array of visual and textual materials of the period; transcribing and editing poems two ways; and/or creating competing ways to insert poems into existing (or imagined) anthologies. To prepare for these experiments, we will dive into  scholarship on editing, poetics, authorship, gender studies, media studies (manuscript, print and digital), and knowledge formation.",

    "overview": "This seminar will examine foundational liberal articulations of feminine sexual consentas well as their historical, political, philosophical, and corporeal failings.  From the perspective of political theory, feminist legal studies, feminist and queer theory, and literary history, we will track the constitutive exclusion of feminine sexual consent from social contract theory over the long eighteenth century in Britain and its colonies (1660 - 1820).  Social contract theorists like Thomas Hobbes and John Locke base political power on consent, not force; but they exempt domestic powerthe power of husbands over wives, fathers over children, masters over servants and slavesfrom contractual reform.  The uneven development of liberal patriarchy is distilled in an ostensibly free woman's agency:  she has the contractual power to agree to marry, but in so doing she ratifies her natural inferiority to her husband.  Become a wife or feme covert, she grants preemptive sexual consent irrespective of her desire.  Even more constitutively repressed by the liberal polis is the intimate violence endured by enslaved African women.  With these foundational occlusions, the seminar will consider pornographic constructions of women's anatomy as performative figurations of feminine consent and pleasure; representations of sex work as potentially critical reflection on legally stipulated masculine conjugal right; sexual violence, rape law, and constraint (within and outside slavery); and women's queer desire and resistance to marriage.  We will also analyze two contemporary cruxes in feminism, feminist legal theory, and the late liberal public sphere:  intersectional evaluations of racial difference and feminism; and the sex wars, dominance feminism, and, with resurgent debate over Title IX, critical claims for feminine weakness as a condition of disciplinary intervention.  A tentative, non-exhaustive list of texts, some of which will be chapters or excerpts, includes:  anonymous prostitute narratives; Mary Astell, Some Reflections on Marriage; Penelope Aubin, The Noble Slaves; Wendy Brown, States of Injury:  Power and Freedom in Late Modernity; John Cleland, Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure; Kimberl Crenshaw, \"Close Encounters of Three Kinds:  On Teaching Dominance Feminism and Intersectionality\"; Daniel Defoe, Roxana; Eliza Haywood, Fantomina and/ or Love in Excess; Frances Ferguson, \"Rape and the Rise of the Novel\"; Janet Halley, \"The Move to Affirmative Consent\"; Saidiya Hartman, Scenes of Subjection; Annamarie Jagose, Orgasmology; Mary Hays, The Victim of Prejudice; Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan; Laura Kipnis, Unwanted Advances; John Locke, Two Treatises of Government; Catharine MacKinnon, \"From Practice to Theory, or What is a White Woman Anyway?\"; Carole Pateman, The Sexual Contract; Samuel Richardson, Clarissa (abridged format); Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Emile (Chapter 5); Wendy Warren, \"The Cause of Her Grief':  The Rape of a Slave in Early New England\"; Mary Wollstonecraft, Mary or Maria.",

Against the outdated view that a \"formalist\" modernism, \"autonomous\" in respect to social reality, superseded and opposed \"realist\" modes of aesthetic representation, we'll begin with the premise that modernist realisms generate their innovative forms in order to bear witness to historical actualities and human experience in the rapidly shrinking world of the early twentieth century.  In an era of accelerating technological change, racialized imperialism, machine warfare, and tremendous social upheaval across national borders, all fueled and/or provoked by capitalist expansion, there emerged worldly, engaged, groundbreaking modernist artworks by such boundary-crossing international artists as the Norwegian Ibsen, the Anglo-Indian Kipling, the Polish Conrad witnessing the depredation of Congo by Belgium's King Leopold; the \"semicolonial\" or postcolonial Irish Yeats, Joyce and Beckett, Caribbean Jean Rhys, New Zealander Katherine Mansfield; Americans expatriates Pound and Eliot; and English-born travelers D. H, Lawrence and Virginia Woolf--both critical \"outsiders within\" their native Britain.\n\nWe'll begin with Ibsen's influential play A Doll's House, which helped to launch modernism's critical struggle against the nineteenth-century imperative that art offer \"moral uplift\" to confirm the existing social order. Then, depending on class members' background and interests, we'll study later moments of that critical struggle, choosing such works as Kipling's Kim, Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Mansfield's \"An Indiscreet Journey,\" Yeats's \"The Second Coming,\" Joyce's \"The Dead\" and Ulysses's \"Penelope\" episode, Eliot's Waste Land, Toomer's Cane, Lawrence's \"Odor of Chrysanthemums,\" Woolf 's Between the Acts, passages of Pound's Pisan Cantos, Beckett's Waiting for Godot, and Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea to put in dialogue with selected secondary texts.",

The first two weeks cover the meteorology necessary for understanding the local and global systems of atmospheric circulation.  This leads to the Kppen climate model which predicts the location of climate types.  With climate as a basis, we then turn to the study of soils and vegetation. Soils are strongly influenced by climate and parent material and they vary in their ability to store water and recycle nutrients.   Processes of plant growth respond directly to climate and soil productivity which leads to biomass production.   All of the biogeographic processes are then used to derive expected patterns of natural vegetation around the world.   Local-scale variations are brought in as modifications of the global model. Discrepancies between the predicted and what is actually found in a particular place   generally reflect the role of human impacts.  Tropical forests, savannas, deserts, grasslands, broadleaf and needleleaf forests, and tundra are all interpretable in terms of the physical processes developed in this course.",

Both a monument to historical continuity as the seat of the Habsburg Empire, and a vortex of revolutionary cultural production, the city provided an environment that fostered the work of pioneering thinkers, researchers and artists whose works dramatically influenced the 20th century. Political and social developments throughout the 19th century resulted in a dramatic decline in the importance of the aristocracy, giving rise to the establishment of an informed, engaged and empowered middle-class citizenry. Sigmund Freud's original work in psychology radically changed how people understood themselves and their position in family and society. Karl Lueger was elected mayor of Vienna on an openly anti-Semitic political platform, and Theodor Herzl campaigned for the establishment of a new Jewish state. In the arts, the intellectual and cultural milieu of the period allowed for daring experimentation in literature, painting, architectural design and music.\n\nWhile acquiring an acquaintance with the artistic, literary, historical and political aspects of fin-de-sicle Vienna, students will work on their academic writing and make use of research tools available in the library and on-line.",

For at least five centuries the legend of Faust has served as means to express the daring and danger of pursuing an aspiration even if it comes at the cost of one's \"soul.\" The specter of a \"Faustian bargain\" often appears when narratives identify individuals whose inordinate achievements are both destructive and self-destructive.  The theme of Faust provides a perspective in which one must thus reflect on the highest and lowest values.\nDr. Faustus has undergone many mutations since he first appeared in the sixteenth century.  This class will be begin with a question at the foundation of the Faust legend:  what do we mean when we speak of our \"soul\"or, alternatively, come to believe that there is no such thing?   While examining this and kindred questions about the nature of moral individuality, the class will continually reflect on what we are doing when we assign a work of art to a particular historical context from \"early modernity\" to the \"post-modern condition.\"  In addition to listening to some musical compositions and reading some shorter texts, we will examine the \"chapbook\" of Faust, which derives from the beginnings of the Protestant Reformation and then proceed to read Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's great drama, Faust I, followed by selections from its strange sequel Faust II, the conclusion to which has always been considered enigmaticas if Goethe, near the end of his life, gave \"world literature\" (a term of his own invention) a disturbing puzzle about the relation between life and literature.  In the final weeks of the quarter, we will view two films, each of which restages the Faust legend for our times, with similarly puzzling results: Taylor Hackford's The Devil's Advocate and Sophie Barthes' Cold Souls.",

    "overview": "Since its extensive theorizing in classical Greek philosophy (Plato, Aristotle) mimesis has provoked an intense discussion not only of its imitative possibilities but also of its disfiguring and excessive potential. In the 20th century the rejection of imitation which dominated the aesthetics of originality around 1800 (Kant, Hegel, Goethe) was challenged by insights into the transformational forces of cultural patterns and the social body as a whole (Tarde). Simultaneously, a variety of philosophical approaches have associated excessive mimetic assimilation with the absorption of the subject into nature (Adorno, Horkheimer), a 'temptation by space' (Caillois), as well as - in our digital age - with memes and the distributive and appropriative dynamics of contemporary media practices. \n\nThe class will address the following questions: In what ways has mimesis been aesthetically 'tamed' since antiquity? Is it possible to find alternatives to the identification of mimesis and imitation in early forms of religious 'minor mimesis' (Auerbach), in Renaissance culture (Burckhard), or in our present media environment - despite the eternal return of the idea of an 'imitation of nature' (Blumenberg)? What are the historical, epistemological, and media-related contexts that afford mimesis to manifest itself as a process of (un)controlled dissemination, multiplication, and reproduction? How do mimetic relations affect the evolution of technical objects (Simondon)? How do they disturb linear concepts of historical developments and call into question mainstream versions of our' modernity (Marx, Benjamin, Latour)?

The forms of trials and standards of evidence have changed a great deal since ancient times when Socrates was condemned to death, and yet the trial still remains the principal means through which society makes its most important judgments.  Trials are also exceptionally revealing of the basic values in society.  What distinguishes the great trials has been how they uncover conflicts about those values, how they preserve for prosperity a sensitivity for justice and injustice, how they symbolize conflicting values, and how often they have stimulated great works of philosophy and literature.  In this course we shall analyze a few of the most famous trials from the ancient world to the twentieth century and ask such questions as what is justice and injustice, what is the role of persuasive rhetoric in trials, how have trials constructed evidence for and against defendants, and most importantly how have the trials of certain individuals stimulated a debate about the fundamental values of society?",

The Watergate scandal is a fascinating tale of partisan mischief, American institutional integrity, journalistic persistence, and the very difficult decision to impeach a President.

These centuries changed the course of European and world history. The Renaissance, the Reformations, the Scientific Revolution, and the Enlightenment unfolded at the same time as European empires spread first into the Mediterranean and then across the Atlantic, spurring the growth of global capitalism and the transatlantic slave trade. Political and religious freedoms emerged alongside new forms of persecution, control, and oppression. A divided Europe grew increasingly connected to the rest of the world as commercial goods, people, ideas, and diseases traveled across land and sea. Among the major themes we'll explore are a) how individuals who lived through these tumultuous centuries experienced their changing world and b) how changes in health, disease, and environment - including the Black Death, the Columbian Exchange, and the climactic cooling period known as the Little Ice Age - drove the religious, political, social, and economic upheavals of the late medieval and early modern periods.\n\nHistory Area of Concentration: European",

We will study the development and implementation of a range of ideologies, including nationalism, liberalism, capitalism, communism, imperialism, and fascism/Nazism. At the beginning of the period, hereditary monarchs and nobles ruled over illiterate peasants throughout most of the continent; two and a half centuries later most Europeans live under democratically elected governments that guarantee universal health care, social security, and a relatively high standard of living.  The transformation of the continent was far, however, from an unending or inexorable story of progress.  In the intervening centuries national states supplanted diverse empires and forcibly assimilated or violently purged ethnic minorities. The European powers conquered most of the world and reluctantly relinquished it only after the devastation of two world wars and bitter struggles for decolonization.  In the wake of Nazi Germany's defeat, Europeans embarked on an unprecedented and remarkably successful project of economic and political unification that over the past decade has confronted economic crises, divisions over mass migration, and the rise of new authoritarian movements.  From the monarchial empires of the eighteenth century to the European Union of the twenty-first, this course will trace the political, social, cultural, and economic transformation of the continent.",

However, I will propose that Asian American history matters regardless of personal identification because the writing of Asian American histories often revises the recounting of the global histories in which Asia and the Americas are located. Instead of a personal history of identity, such an approach considers Asian American history as an integral part of the history of ?modernity', a term that we will also try to unpack through the texts that we will read. We will study this by analyzing how historical accounts of Asian America have been generated (what we might call ?Asian American historiography') and reading about Asian America through primary source documents.",

The continent's poverty is usually explained as the absence of \"modernity\"; ethnic tensions are assumed to be a continuation of ancient tribalism; famines are said to be similar to those in the Bible. In contrast, this course will focus on the processes of modern history that have shaped the continent, emphasizing those that first emerged during the period of colonial rule (ca. 1890 to ca. 1960).  Although we will not minimize the significance of Africa's older historical inheritances, particularly in the realms of religion, family institutions, and political culture, we will see that the presence of such long-standing cultural traditions does not imply the absence of change. On the contrary, one of our central themes will be how traditions have been adapted, transformed, and innovated over the course of the century. Throughout the quarter we will focus on how ordinary men and women struggled to shape their lives. To that end, the imaginative insights provided by African novelists are important complements to the broader historical trends outlined in the lectures and other texts.\n\nHistory Area of Concentration: African/Middle East",

Rather than tracing specific political events, the course will focus on the three major social groups in the Middle East: nomads, peasants and townspeople. Lectures will raise the question of how the process of historical development, as measured by changes in these groups, was altered by the establishment of Islam--and the extent to which Islam itself reflects the characteristics of the Middle Eastern environment. We shall consider the evolution of a distinctly Islamic political and social context; the nature of majority-minority relations; and principles behind the distribution of power, authority and wealth. We will assess the quality of intellectual inquiry according to the goals of those who actually pursued abstract learning.  The course will deal with these topics during the so-called traditional period of Islamic History: 550-1800 C.E.\nN.B., Analysis of course topics will be from the perspective of the social sciences, in particular Anthropology.

This class invites students in the sciences and the humanities to explore the dynamic relationship between science, medicine, and our broader society. From global telecommunications to the atom bomb, and from Darwin to genomics, the emergence of modern science has been intimately tied to technological development, shifting political structures, changing conceptions of racial and sexual difference, and even our definitions of life and illness. While the geographic focus of the course will be on Europe and the United States, we will consistently explore the relationship between modern sciences and the increasingly global nature of commerce and politics since the nineteenth century.

This class examines the two-century debate over what America is and should be by studying its technology.  From the telegraph to social media, from the bicycle to the Apollo mission, from the teapot to the Internet of Things, Americans have identified technology as central to their personal and national destiny.  In this course we will examine the changing process of technological design.  We will consider the way technology has been shaped by the rise of managerial capitalism, the role of the state and global trade, and the rules of intellectual property.  We will examine the perspectives of engineers, consumers, managers, workers, housewives, and hackers, among others.  And we will develop a set of tools for analyzing technological change: systems theory, network analysis, evolutionary theory, social construction, and technological determinism.  Each lecture is organized around the history of a \"representative\" technology.

It was a time of great creativity, change, and expansion but also of pain and disillusionment. From a positive standpoint, this period has been associated with the flourishing of a rich spirituality; the rise of city life; chivalry; the invention of courtly love, the university, and even \"the individual.\" But these achievements came with a price tag. The flipside of medieval spirituality was antisemitism as well as other forms of religious persecution. Cities fostered poverty, discontent, and heresy. Christendom's chivalric impulses culminated in the crusade movement, which very soon turned inward to be used against fellow-Europeans. Courtly love advanced lockstep with virulent antifeminism. The university excluded women, which led to their expulsion from many professions.

The course also explores how these two different societies responded to terrorism, environmental degradation, and immigration and asylum seekers. Finally, we will analyze the reunification of the two German states after 1989 and the challenges that continue to confront Germany today.

Would people of American descent enjoy full citizenship in the new nation-states? What role would American civilizations, cultures, symbols, and languages play in forging national identities? These questions are ongoing, and in many ways they are fundamental to the experience and definition of modern nations throughout the world.

The themes linking both quarters are tensions regarding ethnic and national identity, shifts in gender ideals and family structure, and the effects of imperialist depredation. History 381-1 is a survey of Chinese history from the mid-16th c. second commercial revolution through the fall of the imperial order in 1911. Topics to be explored include Neo-Confucian thought, the imperial state and its problematic relationship with the gentry elite, the Manchu conquest, millenarian movements, commercial and industrial growth, early Chinese nationalism, and revolutionary radicalism. Both classes explore the definition and development of modernity in China. As part of this process, we will question the applicability of the term \"modern\" to Chinese history and consider how the Chinese experience with imperialism has fundamentally shaped their contemporary understanding of their own history.",

Thus, Israel was established as a Jewish state but not exclusively so. The Palestinian Arabs who became Israeli citizens remained nationally and religiously bound to the outside Arab world. This necessarily resulted in a sharp crisis of loyalties, the Arab community being torn between its Israeli citizenship and its Arab national identity. Today the Arab minority constitutes nearly 20 percent of Israel's population. It has undergone intensive processes of change, generally referred to as: Israelization, Palestinization and Islamization. The seminar will focus on minority-majority relations in Israel, with special emphasis on three areas: first, the effect of modernization on the more traditional Arab society; second, the dilemma of national identity (the interrelation between the Israeli, Arab, Palestinian and Muslim/Christian components, the impact of the PLO and Hamas), political participation (Knesset) and the struggle of the Arab minority for equality, and third, the developments following the Oslo Accords, the establishment of the Palestinian Authority and the Intifada (the October 2000 Uprising; the discourse over the \"Jewish and Democratic\" nature of Israel; the search for alternative models - \"State of its Citizens\", separatism, autonomy).",

By then, Chan had become much more than a school of meditation, and its rise gave birth to new genres of Buddhist literature written in semi-vernacular Chinesesuch as \"recorded sayings\" and \"public case\" (Japanese kan) collectionsimportant examples of which we will closely read and analyze. Chan Buddhism was configured as a succession of \"patriarchs,\" but a small number of women also joined their ranks, and we will study their examples and the broader gendered dynamics of Chan. We then turn to the transmission of Chan to Japan through the study of two major figures in Japanese Zen, Dgen and Hakuin. After delving into the history and present-day monastic practice of Korean Seon Buddhism, we conclude by investigating the reception of Chan, Seon, and Zen Buddhism in the modern and contemporary United States.",

Through a combination of readings, site visits, individual and group projects, and critical writing assignments, the goals of this course are, first, to empower students to recognize the pitfalls of how Islam and Muslims are reported and represented in U.S. print media and other formats, and second, to innovate new ways of writing about Islam and Muslims that do not replicate the Islamophobic or Islamophilic tropes that dominate much of this reporting. To these ends, the course will include a &#39;master class&#39; on reporting religion led by by Manya Brachear, religion reporter for the Chicago Tribune. The course is part of the &#34;Talking &#39;Religion&#39;: Publics, Politics and the Media&#34; project which is co-directed by the instructors, and students will have an opportunity to participate in project related activities including lectures and a spring 2019 workshop.",

How do things get excluded or included in this category?  What counts as \"religious\" and why?  Who gets to decide?  This course is an introduction to foundational theories of religion and to the history of the construction of the category of \"religion\" over time.  Throughout the term, you will be working on formulating your own theory of religion, which you will articulate and defend in your final seminar paper.   In this course, you will gain (as ritual theorist Catherine Bell says) \"the skills and tools to make sure that very complicated situations and ideas can be put into words, thereby making it possible to have discussions about issues that can only be discussed if there is language for reflexivity, nuance, counter-evidence, and doubt.\" In the process, you will be asked to make theory translatable to your peers by actively engaging theoretical concepts in creative ways.",

Liturgy is performative and cannot be learned from books alone, any more than one can understand Shakespeare without ever seeing a play. This course aims to provide a concise but intensive introduction to liturgy, including the structure and a brief history of Mass and Office; immersion in some of the central Latin texts of each; the liturgical year; liturgical commentaries; and the theology and practice of the sacraments. We will also provide as much exposure as we can to the manifold objects and works of art created for liturgical use: altar vessels, reliquaries, vestments, altarpieces, choral manuscripts, books of hours, architecture, drama. One session will meet in Special Collections. There will be some practical experience with plainchant, and we may include field trips to compare contemporary high-church liturgy with medieval practice.",

Please, Etgar, tell me a short story with a happy ending, please.\" (From a letter Sayed Kashu'a wrote to Etgar Keret on September 2014).\n\nThis course is for undergraduate and graduate students as well as post doc researchers who are interested in exploring contemporary writings by two prominent writers in Israeli culture, Sayed Kashu'a and Etgar Keret. These writers share unique perspectives on Israeli society: Keret, a son of Holocaust survivors, writes short stories, often surreal and absurdist, that deal with the paradoxes of modern Israeli society; Kashu'a, an Israeli Arab who grew up in the Israeli educational system, writes books and humorous columns in the Hebrew language in which he addresses the problems faced by Arabs in Israel. Shortly after Kashu'a and his family left Israel following a politically charged summer, the two writers began a lively correspondence chronicling their innermost thoughts and trepidations. In this class students will delve into the writers correspondence (which was translated into English and published in the New York Times), explore selective works from both authors, watch films and TV series they have created (such as Keret's movie Jellyfish and Kashu'a's TV series \"Arab Labor\") as well as discuss their other visual works.",

In carrying out this study, we plumb the linguist's toolkit (which includes tools borrowed from mathematics, logic, language acquisition, and experimental psychology) to discover how language scientists determine what a given word or sentence means, and whether that word or sentence means the same thing across occasions of use. This inquiry will lead the student to an understanding of the scientific study of language, by examining how it plays out in the domain of linguistic meaning.

This topic will be explored through recent experimental research in phonetics and phonology examining linguistic flexibility in speaking, listening and comprehending.

In this class we will address some perennial philosophical questions by looking at both classical and contemporary readings.

We then use the symbolism to construct symbolized arguments that correspond to good arguments in natural language, and use the symbolism to show when such natural language arguments---to the extent that the symbolism represents them---are bad.",

We will examine their answers to enduring questions such as: What are the fundamental constituents of reality? What is knowledge, and how do we come to have it? How can we be happy, and what is a good life? What makes for a just society? We will then move on to the Hellenistic period, and will examine Epicurean and Stoic conceptions of how we should live our lives, and why philosophy can help us flourish.

In this course we will examine the views of some of the most important modern philosophersespecially Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Bayle, Locke, Berkeley, and Humeon the nature of God, causation, substance, mind, knowledge, and the material world.

In this class we prove the basic results concerning the First-order Logic (FOL) developed in PHIL 150. We demonstrate, mathematically, that deductive proofs really do establish the correctness of the inferences they represent (this is the Soundness Theorem). We also show that everything (FOL) says is a good inference can be established as such by deduction (this is the Completeness Theorem). Finally, we turn to some other results, among them that there exist non-standard models of arithmetic, and that FOL cannot distinguish the different infinities described by set theory.

For example: What does it take for a system of sentences to count as a good scientific theory? What does it take for a scientific theory to be testable by observational and experimental data (and, by the way: what does it take for certain series of experiences to count as data or observations?)? What does it take for a given theory to be better supported by the available evidence than its competitors? What does it take for a given theory to explain the known phenomena in an area of knowledge? What does it take for an explanatory scientific theory to be credited with reference to underlying structures of reality? We will begin with a brief overview of the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17 th century, and then turn to the treatment of certain problems in the contemporary literature, like the problem of induction, the problem of the underdetermination of theory choice by the available data, the problem of rationality and conceptual change, the problem of realism.",

We will focus on the nature of desire, the relationship between desire and action, and the role of different kinds of motivation in a good life. We will explore the metaphysical, moral-psychological, and ethical aspects of desire. Some of the questions we will discuss are: Do human and non-human animals share the same kinds of desires? Are there different species of motivational states? Are desires a sort of belief, a kind of affective state, or something else? How does desire relate to pleasure, pain, and the emotions? We will read works by Plato, Aristotle, and Stoic philosophers.'",

Or would it, rather, be good to act in some way only if you have good reason to want to do so? Good morally, or good for you, or both?

    "overview": "It seems that a very robust commonsense requirement for our beliefs, knowledge claims, and conceptions to be correct and epistemically authoritative (i.e. so that if we hold the contrary, we ought to correct ourselves) is that they adequately represent a reality that is in some sense independent from these claims, their structure, and the fact that we hold them. The expectation is that this explains that we are sometimes right or wrong no matter what we believe. Likewise, the reference to a construction-independent' reality seems helpful in tracking epistemic norms. It seems to tell us how our judgments, hunches and generalizations are under public, 'objective' constraints that are equally epistemically obligatory for anyone with a claim that their beliefs, assertions or conceptions are true and/or refer to this publicly accessible reality. The philosophical assumption of a mind-independent accessible reality is called realism'. The set of norms that bind our claims to knowledge and representational correctness to a subject-independent reality as the tribunal' can be called objectivity-norms', expressed in claims' being true or false, representative of fact or fiction etc. These norms are currently under politically motivated attack by the outright rejection of truth and the possibility that established theories are objectively correct, by the propagandistic rhetoric of fake news', by the false equivalence between established science and hyped-up pseudoexplanations, manufactured doubt and conspiracy-theories. These challenges look new (and shocking) in contemporary political culture. They make a defense of realism, science and objectivity-norms look desirable because the reference to a shared and equally epistemically obliging set of realities seems indispensable for rational collective belief fixation and thus ultimately, democratic forms of will formation, too. However, new as such challenges may seem to contemporary politics, philosophers of science (i.e. philosophers trying to understand the set of institutions concerned with establishing and scrutinizing objectivity-claims) have been discussing realism and its challengers anti-realism, social constructivism, relativism for decades after the mature sciences themselves produced theories postulating entities whose control, measurement and observation is no longer obviously theory-independent' (like electrons, genes, deficit trends). This course is based on these debates and aims at helping to clarify what it takes to defend of norms of scientific objectivity and reality constraints on beliefs' correctness, and what of the challenges it needs to accommodate. Many philosophers of science have drawn from these debates the lesson that the conception of objectivity and realism operative in contemporary science is best explicated in terms of indispensable pragmatic presuppostions. The course will then look at new work on the defense of climate science results and the development of social ontology that discusses the reality and social nature of conceptions of race, gender and other identity-markers'. Both will show that skeptical attitudes directed at each must rely on questionable and largely discredited assumptions from the philosophy of science.",

His impact on philosophy cannot be overstated. Spinozanotorious and often vilified in his own timenow seems like the Early Modern philosopher closest to being our contemporary. His radically unorthodox views now seem not troubling but innovative. Both Descartes and Spinoza were profoundly systematic thinkers.

It is more common to hold such commitments on the basis of experience than to embrace them simply because one is convinced by some argument. Love for another person on the basis of direct experience and appreciation of him is a paradigm example. The reasons that these experiences provide standardly outstrip any attempts to capture them in propositional form. We can therefore have perfectly good reason to value what we do, while being faultlessly incapable of saying what these reasons are. This calls into question a methodological assumption of a great deal of practical philosophy: normative commitments should be based on reasons, and these reasons should be expressible as claims that could figure in a philosophical argument. According to this ideal, if we lack such reasons, we should revise or suspend our commitments. We will consider instances of the phenomenon in question, ask how to make sense of the idea that experiences could rationally ground our normative commitments, consider comparisons and contrasts with the case of beliefs based on perception, and discuss some implications of rejecting the ideal of articulacy about our reasons for moral commitment, moral education and political reasoning.",

Is the rule of law a meaningful aspiration for a legal system that is fair and ensures everyone, including government officials are equally accountable? Or is the phrase a cynical ruse on behalf of the powerful to control wealth, territory, and populations? This course will explore the origins of the concept in European political thought and compare selected theorists' descriptions of the relation between law's form and political consequences.\n\nThe course will focus substantively on the use of state violence and civil penalties in contexts of war, families, and corporations, including the university. The jurisprudence of U.S. statutory interpretation will be explored through analysis of debates about the implementation of national security and sexual harassment policies. The theoretical frameworks of Max Weber, Walter Benjamin, Franz Kafka, Carl Schmitt, Hans Kelsen, H.L.A. Hart, Lon Fuller, Jacques Derrida, Catherine MacKinnon, Jeremy Waldron, and Janet Halley will be compared for their usefulness in understanding the interpretation of contemporary laws and imagining alternatives. The purpose of this class is to introduce students to the primary texts, theories, and techniques necessary for grasping the rule of law in the United States today. Your grade will be based on assessments of one-page weekly papers analyzing a citation of your choice from the assigned texts; a class presentation; participation; and a final paper.\n\nThis class introduces students to the primary texts, theories, and techniques necessary for grasping the rule of law in the United States today. The objective is to improve basic legal literacy in the context of larger questions of political and legal theory. Skills student learn include legal research using online databases, including LexisUni, and Proquest Congressional research databases, as well as how to understand the U.S. Code and Code of Federal Regulations. Students learn these skills in the context of reflecting on larger principles of statutory interpretation -- does a law mean what the plain text says, what Congress \"intends,\" or a \"purpose\" imputed to law by judges?",

Why do governments choose to protect some industries behind high tariff walls while leaving others exposed to the vagaries of international competition? Why do most countries rely on the U.S. dollar for their primary reserve currency - and will the dollar continue to serve that function? Why have many countries removed barriers to cross-border financial flows - and what are the social and political consequences of financial market openness? Does international trade and investment make military conflict less or more likely? Do economic sanctions even work? Have the series of economic crises over the past half-decade - the 2008 financial market meltdown in the U.S., the global credit crunch the followed, and the ongoing sovereign debt crises (in the Eurozone countries and elsewhere) - shifted the distribution of global economic and political power? \n\nIn this course we will develop an analytical toolkit to provide some insight into these and other questions, paying particular attention to evaluating the theoretical arguments with two types of evidence: qualitative and historical and quantitative and cross-national.\n\nThe course is organized thematically. We start with an introduction to the study of International Political Economy (IPE) and explore why it is distinct from international economics; following the introduction to the course we will discuss the problem of international cooperation when national economic policies have spillover effects. The next three topics (weeks 2-6) are devoted to three of the main issue areas that concern IPE specialists: the politics of the international trade, monetary, and financial systems. We then turn our attention to economic development strategies pursued by low- and middle-income countries and the role of foreign development aid in promoting growth. The last two weeks of the course are devoted to the relationship between transnational economic linkages and conflict and to the rise of new economic powerhouses (namely, China) and the possible consequences of this shift for American influence in global economic affairs.",

    "overview": "While those going in to the field of mental health typically think about it as a \"helping profession\", there is much more than meets the eye when it comes to the political and economic issues that have shaped the development of the field. The purpose of this course is to explore some of these historical and economic forces that have shaped the field as it exists today. The course will begin with an exploration of the role of state mental hospitals in the U.S. in the early to mid-20th century, and examine the political forces that drove the de-institutionalization movement of the 1970s and 1980s. The course will also focus on the evolution of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (now in its 5th edition), and some of the problems that have emerged from the disease-based framework utilized in the manual. The aggressive way in which the DSM has been marketed internationally will be discussed. Finally, the course will explore critiques of the pharmaceutical industry and modern psychiatry, as well as the impact of a range of contemporary forces on the practice of psychotherapy. Some of these themes will also be explored through analysis of popular films and other media.",

Class lectures, readings, and laboratory experiences in combination will convey a sense of some of the foundational questions and methods of the science of psychology. Ultimately, the goal of this course is to impart an initial understanding of some fundamentals of human nature and behavior, as well as instill a deeper appreciation for the science of psychology. To this end, 10 hours of laboratory experience are required across the quarter to allow you to have first-hand experience of the way research is conducted in psychology. Alternatively, a paper (requiring roughly the same number of hours outside of class) reviewing primary research articles in psychology may be substituted for the laboratory experience. If you are under the age of 18, you must use the paper requirement to satisfy your laboratory credit.",

This view suggests that differences across languages mold the thoughts of their users. \n\nThe Whorfian hypothesis was investigated in the 1960's and then (for reasons we'll discuss) it fell out of favor. Recently there has been a surge of new research on the Whorfian hypothesis in several domains. In this class we will discuss stronger and weaker forms of this hypothesis, and consider evidence for and against this hypothesis, as well as different ways in which language could interact with cognition. We will read papers that compare semantic structures across languages, as well as empirical papers that test whether these semantic differences matter in nonlinguistic tasks.  The domains of study include space and number (which have both been the focus of much recent empirical work). We will also consider some of the following:  causation, theory of mind, counterfactual reasoning, and color.",

    "overview": "Questions about the nature of the mind have been asked throughout human existence, and yet gaining a complete and satisfactory understanding of the phenomenon of cognition has remained a challenge. The daunting complexity of the brain, the remarkable flexibility of human thought, and the apparent paradox of a brain being able to understand itself have combined to make this goal elusive. \n\nHowever, in recent years, a set of promising new ways of approaching the study of the mind have emerged as a result of two forces: (1) the interaction and collaboration of scientists studying cognition in a variety of disciplines, and (2) the advent of computers, which make it possible to build testable models (in the form of computer programs) of various aspects of intelligence. The fields of cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence, linguistics, philosophy, anthropology, and neuroscience have all contributed to these endeavors, and the result has come to be known as cognitive science -- the interdisciplinary study of the mind. \n\nThis course focuses on three main areas: learning, knowledge representation, and reasoning. Some of the issues we explore are the nature of concepts and how they are acquired and used; how experiences are stored in memory and what determines when they are retrieved; how children's minds develop into adult minds, and how this compares to what happens when adults learn a new domain. We will cover current research on whether the language we speak affects the way we think and discuss new findings on animal cognition. The goal of the course is not merely to survey research in these areas, but rather to explore current theories and to describe the evidence - psychological, computational, and linguistic - that supports or challenges them.",

Climate change novels ask: how might climate change transform the world in which we live? What will the world be like in the future, and what will it mean to the human beings who live in it? The alternative visions of the future elaborated in the works of climate change fiction often combine characteristics of science fiction with elements of other genres, including the romance, the thriller, and the adventure tale. In addition to inquiring into the literary issue of how and with what literary means these novels manage to imagine the future, we will seek to understand: if and how literature manages to imagine a process as widely taken to be \"unimaginable\" as is climate change, whether fiction might further human knowledge or awareness or if it might modify human actions in the world. We will engage in close and detailed reading and discussion of some of the most compelling contemporary Cli-Fi novels and in writing about them critically. This seminar requires active and engaged student participation.",

In so doing, we study several major literary developments in the history of French-language literature, from the philosophical and epistolary novel in the 18th century, to Romanticism, Realism, and the Fantastic in the 19th century, and the roman beur and migrant Qubcois literature in the 20th century. We study the differences between these texts in terms of narrative and literary techniques and relate them to changing historical and cultural contexts. The aim is to familiarize students with various periods in the history of the French-language novel as well as help them develop skills in literary reading and analysis.

    "overview": "It has often been said that reading and interpreting are acts of detecting; that a story provides us with clues that we must decipher and align in order to construct a meaning. We are thus enjoined to read beyond the obvious and the visible and to excavate the story of its invisible secrets that may hold the key to its drama. However, it is also held that no story is ever exhausted by its readings; that a work of literature is an unbounded world of potentialities, offering us opportunities to reread indefinitely. Thus, the solution to which we arrive at the end of each reading/detecting is always provisional and an invitation to read again. At the core of these reflections lies the question of knowledge: what do we and how do we know it. In this course, we will test this double hypothesis about reading and detecting by focusing on detective works of fiction from the Francophone African world. We will begin by exploring by reviewing the history of the development of the genre, in particular in French and its American influences and inspirations through two major literary figures, Edgar Allen Poe and Chester Himes. Then we will read literary works and some theoretical works in order to examine the ways in which the form of the detective is mobilized by authors to reflect the specific political, historical, and social questions constituting the worlds of these stories.",

Central to our concerns are three overlapping forms of feminist thought and writing that emerged in postwar France--existentialist, psychoanalytic and marxist, and their shared view, articulated by Beauvoir, that one is not born a woman, but becomes one. Our questions include: how does a given author conceptualize 'woman' and 'becoming woman'? what are the implications of that process for women's lived existence? how does that understanding of the social construction of gender shape an author's conception of the political potential of writing? In addition to the literary works with which we begin, we will read numerous critical writings related to these concerns by authors including Cixous and Wittig.",

    "overview": "Both as body' and as genre' this course tracks the ways in which form' shapes and responds to violent imagery across French and European literature of the 16th century. Even now, we think of love as a shot from Cupid's bow. We burn for our beloveds; our hearts break; we are torn apart by conflicting desires and stabbed with jealousy. However, these images are faint echoes of the language of violence of centuries ago, when early modern French, English and Italian poets described their love as torture, massacre and wounding, and their Beloveds as bloodthirsty tyrants. We will interrogate this violence to examine what metaphors of torment and abjection allowed early modern poets to do. We will pay close attention to the transmigration of imagery, stylistic devices and discursive postures across literary kinds. How does the eroticized body of the Beloved in the Petrarchan sonnet become the wounded flesh of the Huguenot soldier during the Wars of Religion? How does the anatomized female form in the blason come to represent European nations torn apart by civil strife? We will examine structural and formal conventions as well as historical and political contexts in exploring the conversations between our texts and the turbulent times in which they were created. Authors will include Michel de Montaigne, William Shakespeare, Franois Rabelais, Marguerite de Navarre, Francesco Petrarca and Edmund Spenser.\n\n**Please note: in addition to exploring early modern literary texts, this course will also focus on\nstudents' professional development through discussions of academic research, writing, and publishing.**",

    "overview": "Our 19th Centuries: Prehistories of the 20th Century\n\nGodard says of the cinema that it was essentially \"a nineteenth-century matter that was resolved in the twentieth century\". For the cinema, the emblematic medium of the twentieth century, turned the powers specific to it (e.g., montage, projection photography) to articulating or developing aesthetic, philosophical and political problems posed by literature, philosophy and painting in the previous century. This invites us to think the relationship between centuries in two ways. First, problems posed in the 19th-century continue to shape (and limit the possibilities of) the forms in which twentieth-century art mobilizes its powers. For, having outlived the situation in which they were initially formulated, these problems continue (in Marx's phrase) to \"weigh like a nightmare on the brains of the living\". Second, it becomes necessary for those who find themselves within this history to conduct an archaeology of nineteenth-century art and thought as a prehistory of twentieth-century culture. This course will explore these questions by reading canonical literary texts of the 19th century (by authors such as Balzac, Flaubert, Baudelaire and Zola) alongside cinematic works (such as those of Buuel, Renoir, Marker, Walsh and Godard), as well as critical texts (such as Benjamin, Jameson, Kracauer, Deleuze and Rancire).",

This course examines how, in these seminars, Foucault displaces the concept of truth from the domain of logos to that of life.  We will focus in particular on Foucault's interrogation of two ideas: parrhsia (or fearless speech) and forms of life.  According to his analysis, the two notions are related to each other, as fearless speech reveals itself to have not only a political dimension but also an ethical one, which aims at transforming the subject's way of life through the exercise of courage.  Foucault traces the argument of his seminars back to an array of Greek, Hellenistic, and Roman sources.  Finally, although he does not make gender an overt central focus of his late thought, we will consider to what extent this category may be seen to play a crucial role in extending the practices of truth-telling and care of the self.\n\nWe will place Foucault's final seminars in dialogue with a selection of excerpts from ancient texts including Plato's Apology and Laches, Euripides's Ion, and Epictetus's Discourses as well as from contemporary works such as Hadot's Philosophy as a Way of Life, Foucault's own The Hermeneutics of the Subject, Agamben's The Highest Poverty, and Sara Ahmed's Living a Feminist Life.",

The poem is both an adventure story and an exhaustive, assessment of the state of politics, society, religion, literature, philosophy, and theology at the beginning of the fourteenth century. This course examines a selection of cantos Dante's Inferno and Purgatorio in its cultural, social and political context. In particular we will explore how the underground world imagined by the poet relates to late medieval urban life and culture. A guiding concern of the discussion is to assess the ways in which Dante changed our understanding of the relationship between the human and the divine, justice and love, will and reason, happiness and knowledge, literature and the Bible. Political turmoil, philosophical and theological paradigms social and religious conflict all converge in the making of Inferno and Purgatorio and will thus form crucial elements of our investigation.",

We'll take a diachronic perspective and a cultural studies approach in order to chart the emergence of a modern, proto-pop Italian Style from its early stage in the work of the Futurists under the Fascist regime, to its evolution in the postwar years. Key selected novels and films that registered the transformation of Italian society and its crisis from the early Fifties to the late Sixties will provide the focus of this class, operating as what film critic Giampiero Brunetta has called \"a sort of public diary\" of Italy's transformation. Films, novels, commodities made in Italy showcased domestically and internationally the process of re-construction of Italy's self-representation. The fortune of the lure of Made in Italy and of the Italian Style was decreed by the economic and cultural success Italian products gained internationally, and contributed to feedback into Italians the sense of their graduation into modernity.",

This course introduces the relationship between social, cultural, political, and economic forces on the one hand, and legal rules, practices, and outcomes, on the other.

Why do people go to court? How does the legal system work? What is the role of lawyers, judges, and juries? How does law on the books differ from law in action?

We will also look at how childhood itself has been viewed as a social problem.  Children and adolescents and their behavior have often been considered to be the root of many social concerns (such as teen pregnancy, suicide, and bullying).  But also many social problems arise because of society's feeling that children and young people need to be protected (such as calls to end child labor and the \"missing child\" awareness movement).\n\nThe final topic for the course will be how adolescents make the transition to adulthood socially, emotionally, and economically, and how this transition has changed over time - particularly over the last several decades.",

    "overview": "The U.S. 1970s Women's Health Movement demanded everything from safe birth control on demand to an end to for-profit healthcare. Some participants formed research collectives and published D-I-Y guides to medical knowledge such as the Boston Women's Health Collective's Women and Their Bodies or Carol Downer's A New View of a Woman's Body. Some movement members established battered women's shelters, underground abortion referral services, and feminist health clinics. Others formed local committees and national networks, such as the Committee for Abortion Rights and Against Sterilization Abuse (CARASA) and the National Women's Health Network (NWHN), with the goal of transforming contemporary medical protocols and scientific research agendas. Because many of these local and national groups are still in existence, original movement goals continue to define the parameters of a \"women's health\" agenda in the present moment. \n\nOn the other hand, the Women's Health Movement was (and is) a heterogeneous movement. Then, as now, groups with competing ideas about the healthcare needs of women as a group identified as part of same movement. Thus, an examination of historical and current debates over \"women's health\" is also a means of assessing several distinct, often competing, paradigms of health and disease. Moreover, how we articulate a \"women's health agenda\" depends on our (often taken-for-granted) ideas about gender, sexuality, and embodiment itself.",

From the 1790s until the middle of the twentieth century, Western feminism fought on two fronts, condemning women's legal and political disenfranchisement as well as practices, like the wearing of corsets, that subordinated women at the level of everyday life.  GSS 231 will explore feminism in America after the legal and political battle has, to some extent, been won.  We'll examine the so-called second wave of feminism, from the mid-1960s to the end of the 1970s.  This radical, widespread, and intimately critical phase of the feminist movement attacked inequity that persisted beyond women's nominal political and legal enfranchisement.  The second wave locates oppression in personal lifein intercourse, domestic labor, fashion, representation, art, family, and loveto assert that mainstream norms, habits, and assumptions operate just as powerfully as repressive laws.  Because much second-wave feminist argument exists in the forms of physical activism, cultural interventions, and artistic production, we will encounter a variety of media:  academic prose, but also manifestos, journalism, film, visual art, video art, novels, and performances.  At the same time that we track the historical roots and articulations of this feminist movement, an ongoing goal of the class will be to investigate the critical methods pioneered by the second wave.  What analytic tools does second-wave feminism use to criticize culture?  What conceptual, aesthetic, and concrete resources does second-wave feminism deploy to project equitable, revolutionary, and even utopian reconfigurations of gendered power?  We will contemplate the fate of the second wave today, as the #MeToo movement replicates (or fails to replicate) some second-wave arguments and aporias.",

    "overview": "The selection of Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale for this year's \"One Book One Northwestern\" gives us an occasion to think again about \"patriarchy.\" A term of feminist political discourse and analysis, \"patriarchy\" operated at the core of second wave feminist theories about the domination and oppression of women.  But the concept (and the word) found themselves eclipsed if not entirely dismantled in the 1980s, as \"Third Wave\" feminist critiques of gender, sexuality, and race, and new approaches to relations of power, identities, and subjectivities, emerged. These interventions included work that not only complicated, problematized, and intersected the feminist subject but also introduced analytics that troubled the coherence of the category \"women\" and deconstructed totalizing notions like \"patriarchy\" and \"oppression.\" But political upheavals, irruptive events, and new articulations of relations of power have a way of changing (and reviving) terms of political discourse, bringing the moribund back to life.   Our aim in this course, in a time of authoritarian rule, state-sponsored gendered and reproductive violence, renascent white supremacy, the militarization of society, and virulent rhetorics of sexual humiliation, brutality, and misogyny, is to take stock of the meaning, significance, and revitalization of discourses of patriarchy through the interpretation of (mostly) contemporary feminist theorists and texts.  Rather than seeking a definition of patriarchy or attempting a conceptual history (much less assuming its stability as an explanatory concept) , we'll simply investigate how it appears in  selected writings and gets theorized, encoded, wielded, and weaponized by feminist writers in disparate ways, whether as  \"male power\" \"masculine domination,\" \"the law of the father,\" \"the androcentric principle,\"  \"the sexual contract,\" \"phallocentrism,\" \"heterosexuality,\" \"heteropatriarchy,\"  \"colonial masculinity,\" or just (following Marilyn Frye on B Friedan), \"the problem that has no name.\" Readings include selections from J Adams; E Barkley Brown; W Brown; V Bryson; J Butler; Combahee River Collective; A Davis; V Das; J Halberstam; P Hill Collins; C Enloe; M Frye; H Hartmann; L Irigaray; C Mackinnon; K Manne; JS Mill; S Ortner; Radicalesbians; D Roberts; H Spillers; U Narayan; J Rose; E Wingrove; M Wittig (and others).",

Throughout this period, American business has seen a transformation in the way risk is evaluated, capital is raised, and organizations are led.  The \"rules of the game\" during this period have changed radically in terms of corporate control, business management and wealth creation. We will explore the transformations in business and commerce during the past four decades that have led to current trends and problems.\n\nStudents interested in the recent history of Wall Street, financial markets, and business culture will enjoy this class. It will also appeal to students intrigued by late 20th and early 21st century American society - specifically how business and American industries have influenced America's identity. Those who may want to explore a career in business should find the seminar helpful in preparing for many types of professions across disciplines.\n\nStudents will be exposed to topics such as leveraged buyouts, junk bonds, venture capital investing, the \"Internet Bubble\", entrepreneurial management, hedge funds and derivatives. In addition, we will explore public policy trends around issues including corporate takeovers, technology transfers, risk management and business investment. A common theme throughout the quarter will be how capitalism has evolved over the past few decades, and how this has changed the mindset of business professionals and the American workforce. It will be up to you to determine if this evolution has been beneficial or detrimental to American society.\n\nThis will not be a seminar grounded in heavy technical economic and financial analysis or market theory. You will not need an academic background in economics to understand the topics of the class. No pre-requisites are necessary.\n\nBecause students are not expected to have previous knowledge of these topics, the reading list is significant. Students are expected to complete readings prior to class. Please refer to the reading list for primary texts that will be used for the class. There will also be supplemental readings, including articles and essays, that will be provided by the instructor.\n\nAs part of the class, we will have a series of guest panels and lectures by business professionals from Chicago, New York and San Francisco including investment bankers, corporate attorneys, business CEOs and private equity professionals.",

The course is designed to provide opportunities for music aficionados to experience music and music theater events from the inside-out. The only prerequisite for the course is a love of the performing arts - you don't have to read, perform, or understand music notation to succeed. However, you have to be prepared to spend a lot of time attending rehearsals and concerts (minimally six to eight hours a week), outside of the two required class sessions. During and outside of classroom sessions, the instructor and invited guests will attempt to nurture a heightened awareness of the challenges that conductors, opera and music theater directors and musicians/actors face when preparing for a performance. Through a series of observations, presentations, interviews, and interactive discussions/seminars, you will be better prepared to listen, observe, and critically analyze performing arts events on and off campus - during this academic quarter, and hopefully for the rest of your life. After Week One's introduction to the course and the music library, the Week Two class sessions will concentrate on conducting lessons and video observations of concerts and rehearsals. In these initial sessions, you will learn many of the techniques needed to lead the world's greatest instrumental and choral ensembles (of course, with many additional years of practice). Course participants, using their required conductor's baton and music CDs will learn a variety of conducting techniques - mastering beat patterns, the expressive use of the left hand, and using the conducting gesture to communicate interpretation, phrasing, dynamic shading. You may never conduct a major ensemble, but after meeting the requirements of the class you should have the knowledge and understanding to critically analyze conductors during your future career as a member of audiences for classical and popular music concerts.",

Critical issues include: the emergence of \"Romantic\" ideologies of music and their consequences; music as an emblem of cultural or national identity; changing ideas about performance and the role of the performer; the tension between experimental and traditional approaches to composition; anxieties about the boundary between \"Western Art Music\" and its others; and changing attitudes toward the musical past, including canon-formation and the writing of \"music history\" itself.",

Considering plainchant, organum, song, and motet, the class will be organized as a pro-seminar in which lectures are balanced by student discussion of musical repertoire and significant scholarship. Participants will broaden their existing knowledge of medieval music and history, acquire a working knowledge of traditions of French and Spanish music notation, ponder ideas about the theoretical and cosmological understandings of music in medieval culture, and link music to other medieval arts.</p>",

We'll compare some of his compositions to similar ones by other composers, and will spend at least a week on Dido and Aeneas.

This course will examine how opera composers (and singers, directors, and audiences) have grappled with the genre - and the question of its continued cultural relevance - from 1900 to the present. Operas to be studied may include works by Debussy, Puccini, Strauss, Janek, Weill, Berg, Gershwin, Britten, Stravinsky, Messiaen, Adams, and others. Beyond repertoire, we will consider shifts in how opera has been staged, sung, marketed, and mediated. Students will be expected to attend a \"Live in HD\" transmission from the Metropolitan Opera and/or other local performances of relevant repertoire.",

It explores how performance helps the performer and audience to understand a text; it considers in what ways a performance can \"match\" a written text; and it examines the techniques of performance. Students write three critical papers and give three live, graded performances.  There are some quizzes and workshops.  The class is neither an acting class nor an English class, but it draws on practices fundamental to both. Much of class time will be devoted to performance of texts and rigorous critical discussion of the performances and the works on which they are based. Consequently, attendance is mandatory.  It examines the role of the audience in the critical reception of the text.  The course is designed for both students with little prior performance experience and those with considerable theatrical experience.\n\nIt is an excellent course for students to take who want to become excellent communicators; it hones your professional skills and gives you the poise and confidence to excel in the \"real world.\"",

The main questions that animate the course are: What is the role of performance art in our highly mediatized culture? What kind of aesthetic and political intervention does performance art make and how has this changed historically? What forms of presence, collectivity, and memory does performance art enable as a fluid, fugitive art form with its own materiality and \"staying\" power? Class sessions will alternate between reading discussions, student presentations on individual artists and collectives, guest perfomers, and performance exercises. Reading materials include canonical texts as well as more recent work such as the exhibit catalogues Arte No Es Vida, Radical Presence: Black Performance in Contemporary Art and Radical Women: Latin American Art, 1960-1985. Students will develop solo and group performance pieces and will write critiques and a final paper.",

Through critical essays and performance exercises, the course engages performance as analytic, research method, and event. The course gives students the opportunity to explore elements such as text, space, objects, and storytelling from an aesthetic and critical perspective. What are the issues that are central to studies of performance when bodies are on display or when a story is communicated to an audience? In what ways does a poetic rendition of an ethnographic interview make a statement about the politics of the research process, disrupting notions of linearity and authority that characterize Western epistemology? How do narrative voice choices impact the politics of a performance? The aim of the course is to explore performance as a meaning-making practice, paying close attention to the role of embodied behavior in the production, interpretation, and dissemination of knowledge.",

Teams connect diverse, distributed individuals, empowering them to work collaboratively. Those working in, leading, and studying teams have repeatedly observed that teams can accomplish more than the sum or member capabilities (i.e., synergy), but often accomplish less than would the same individuals working alone (i.e., process loss). This course will explore the forces that affect behavior in teams, and the factors that lead to team success. The course will explore the specific challenges associated with leading teams, some of which include: building and designing teams, managing information sharing within and across teams, structuring effective group decision processes, igniting creative thinking, enabling complex problem solving, managing team diversity and conflict, and managing teams of teams. This is an introductory course, with no prerequisites. We will use a variety of readings, activities, and class activities to build team leadership skills.

Building on simple real-world examples and exercises that build data literacy, this course introduces key concepts and methods selected from recent interdisciplinary research on networks, social media, machine learning, the wisdom of crowds, and prediction markets. Cultural Analytics provides you with tools to apply this research to make predictions about the market for cultural goods like music, film, books, and computer games. It explores factors that make prediction hard (e.g., social influence, ICTs, and the new digital economy) and gives you alternatives using the potential of Big Data. Specifically, you will learn how to plot and interpret graphs to measure performance in cultural markets; use Internet search data and Twitter conversations to forecast trends; build, visualize, and explore networks; train machine learning algorithms for prediction; and harness the wisdom of crowds. Additionally, some practical components of the course will teach you how to work with IBM's Watson Analytics, an easy-to-use yet powerful and comprehensive data analysis tool. The course provides core data science and modeling skills as well as \"soft skills\" like problem-solving, communication, and project management. Its main goals are to help you recognize the potential of Big Data-driven approaches and equip you with the knowledge to critically assess the quality of your findings. Except an open mind, there are no prerequisites for the class. While formal thinking is encouraged, the course focuses on providing conceptual foundations and hands-on tools that apply across a variety of creative sectors.",

In the middle decades of the 20th century, radio plays were among the most popular forms of fiction in many parts of the world. Legends have come down about thrillers of the 1930s, but these remain poorly understood, and are not representative of the broad work of experimental writers in the medium. In this class you will learn how radio dramas were made in three historical periods: classic American (1937-54); mid-century British (1954-1974) and contemporary global traditions. We will explore the cultural and political background of each of these contexts, practice how to \"read\" a radio play, and even do some dramatic radio writing.  Some radio dramatists we will consider include: Samuel Beckett, Neil Gaiman, Dylan Thomas, Langston Hughes, Orson Welles, Lucille Fletcher, Tom Stoppard, Gregory Whitehead, Ray Bradbury, Eli Horowitz and Harold Pinter. Students with a background or interest in media history, podcasts, creative writing, theatre history, performance, voice studies or literature are especially welcome.",

Because of their rote predictability, these programs are commonly written off as blandly reassuring (e.g. House Hunters), as guilty pleasures (Hallmark Christmas movies), or as just plain boring.  At the same time, the meanings of formulaic TV shows are considered quite obvious, based on the simple, repetitive formula.  This class challenges the adequacy of these approaches.  We look closely and carefully at formulaic television, challenging received assumptions about quality, complexity, and value that dominate current cultural discourses about television.  We wonder about the relationship (or difference) between reassuring predictability and boredom; we ask how a TV show that bores some people captivates others, who may in turn watch an equally formulaic program instead; we downplay the importance of the formula as the sole generator of meaning and feeling.",

The turn towards sound in humanities research has the potential to decenter dominant modes of thinking as well as to recover aspects of history and experience now forgotten or obscured. Inspired by that potential, we will consider questions such as: What methodologies best enable the study of sound? How can we write a history of auditory experience? How has listening changed in the era of modern media? How can we understand the ethical dimensions of listening? How are sounds combined with mediated images and associated with particular bodies? What is the relationship between the voice and identity? How might a focus on sound facilitate new encounters with the environment and its human and nonhuman inhabitants?",

The primary creative responsibility of the actor is to generate human character within the given circumstances of a play.

Since the 1980s, neoliberalism has been the dominant strain in Anglo-American economic and political thought.  When the Cold War ended in the mid-1990s, neoliberalism spread around the globe. Socialism had been discredited. Capitalism had been vindicated.  The main result, however, was not the universal prosperity that neoliberals promised.  Instead, the rich became much richer, while almost everyone else either became poorer, or improved their lives only marginally.  In this class, we will read a selection of successful, challenging plays that have been produced during this time.  Among the writers we will study will be Caryl Churchill, John Guare, David Henry Hwang, and August Wilson.  As we read these plays, we will also read other textsjournalism, economic history, and social theorythat will help us flesh out the complex and pressure-laden cultural contexts in which these plays exist. As we compare and contrast dramatic texts to texts from other genres, we will try to come to a realistic view of the constraints and the possibilities that characterize contemporary theatre practices during this time of ever-widening economic, cultural, and symbolic inequity.",

    "overview": "In the second year we study the traditional canon of Western Drama to discover what each contributes to the theory, principles, and techniques of interpretation of drama from the point of view of the actor. In this first quarter we will focus on Greek Tragedy, perhaps the starkest form of drama. We will experiment with epic-sized characters expressing the deepest of human emotions, while trying to unite the voice work from sophomore year with an understanding of the text. We will experiment with different ideas in staging using some of the trappings of the period (masks, robes, headdress, shoes), with the ritual aspects of the dramas, with movement and sound. Also, and of utmost importance: the original thespians were men. I encourage all of you to explore all roles, without regard to sexual/gender identity. Women will play the male roles! Men will explore the female roles. This is quarter in which I challenge the students and their notions of identity.",

When did theatrical design transition from a codified form of representation into a medium for artistic expression?  What techniques and philosophies of past designers still speak to modern practice?  How does technology create new breakthroughs in design and performance? To explore these questions, this course will trace staging from its hillside origins in ancient Greece, through the revolutions that occurred in the early twentieth century, when artists like Adolph Appia and Alexandra Exter pioneered practical scenography, and up to the collaborative working models and new technologies that have carried director-designers like Julie Taymor into the twenty-first century. In addition to reading and participating in discussion, students will present on designers beyond the assigned syllabus, experiment with the techniques of industry innovators in class exercises, and engage in a practice as research final project that generates an extended design statement for a proposed production design.",

We will learn to form scholarly inquiries about dance and to analyze it using both formalistic and theoretical frameworks. These include movement analysis and attention to representations of race, gender, sexuality, class, and nation. This course aims to better understand the sociohistorical and cultural contexts within which dance practices are embedded so that we are better equipped to recognize and unravel our own assumptions, hierarchies, and value-laden paradigms through which we think about and practice dance.",

The focus of this course is on developing flexibility, strength and stamina. Throughout this course we will explore the use of the back in order to gain a larger sense of the use of the torso/spine in modern dance. Students will also gain an understanding of the important contributions these choreographers, among others, have had on the development of modern dance.

    "overview": "ME 373 is the second course in fluid mechanics for undergraduates. ME undergraduates are required to take either Thermodynamics II (ME 370) or this course as a part of the Mechanical Engineering curriculum. Most undergraduates take it during their junior year. \n\nThis course essentially picks up where ME 241 left off. Unlike ME 241 where the subject of fluid mechanics was developed by \"synthesis\" starting from elementary ideas on the nature of fluids, this course takes as its starting point the fundamental equations of fluid flow and proceeds by way of \"analysis\" to explore its myriad consequences and applications.These areas are laid out as broad swaths of contiguous \"territories\": viscous flows, inviscid flows, \"almost\" inviscid flows (boundary layer theory), compressible flows and so on. As we travel through this \"landscape\", theoretical principles are applied to a wide variety of practical problems.\n\nIn ME 241 (a prerequisite for this course) the concept of a fluid and its properties was introduced. The subject was then developed by a method of \"synthesis\" by systematically applying Newton's laws to fluid elements culminating in the fundamental equations of fluid flow  the Euler system of equations (if the fluid is inviscid) or the Navier-Stokes equations in the case of viscous flows. In this course we follow a complementary approach. After giving a brief review of the fundamental equations of fluid flow, we use the method of \"analysis\" to unravel the physical content of these equations. In the process, we learn about a variety of fluid phenomena and its applications such as: supersonic flow and the principles of design of jet engines, viscous boundary layers and the consequent drag on airplane wings, the concept of vorticity and how it describes phenomena such as tornadoes etc.\n\nTopics Include:\n\n Steady viscous flows (exact solutions)\n           Poiseuille flow in round pipes\n           Couette flow between parallel plates\n Inviscid flows \n           concept of vorticity and the generalized Bernoulli theorem\n           irrotational (or potential) flows - the velocity potential and the stream function\n Compressible layers \n           one dimensional isentropic flows - the Laval nozzle\n           Shocks\n Boundary layers \n           Prandtl's boundary layer theory for \"almost\" inviscid flows",

The purpose is to expose students to a variety of skills necessary to advance as a researcher during and after their PhD studies. The topics of teaching and technical writing and presentation are incredibly important in a student's future success and yet are seldom taught in a systematic fashion in standard PhD curricula. This course addresses this need by tackling these topics drawing on the expertise of our own faculty. The course is about 1/2 seminar and 1/2 interactive discussion. Some sessions are run as panel discussions and in several areas students will actively participate and be provided feedback on their performance by the faculty. Areas for student activity include preparation and presentation of a short mini-lecture on a research topic, and writing a proposal for a research or teaching lab need. \n\nContact: Malcolm MacIver\nProfessor: e-mail: maciver@northwestern.edu",

How are you going to produce it, achieve the expected properties, and do so economically and safely?  Which processing variables are going to be the most important in affecting properties and therefore must be controlled carefully, and which are less important and require less stringent (and less costly) control?  These questions are the subjects to be considered in this course.  We will discuss efficient design of experiments, including full and fractional factorials, to determine the most important processing variables, and methods to reach optimum properties with least sensitivity to such variables.  Multiple property optimization to find the best trade-offs of properties, cost, etc will be discussed.  Several lectures in statistics will be given at the beginning of the course to equip everyone with sufficient statistics background to benefit from this course.\n\nRelationship to Department Objectives\nSupports 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16Laboratory project\nTeams of 2-3 students\nEmphasis on design and analysis of experiments",

Students will explore how the Romans exploited the raw materials and adapted the processing and casting technologies to meet the demands of an empire vastly larger than any previous Mediterranean state. From a materials science perspective, the class will examine how metal ore was processed and cast, evident in characteristic microstructures. The resulting data will be used as a basis for understanding the vast trading network associated with metal production and the importance of metallurgy to the Roman economy. As this class will be offered in the McCormick School of Engineering as well as the Weinberg School of Arts and Sciences, we expect equal enrollment from Engineering and Humanities students. Following several weeks of joint instruction, the students will be grouped into teams to undertake and present various aspects and theories of historical and scientific research into Roman metal production.",

This course provides an understanding of how and why \"money\" developed: as a way to facilitate barter, store value (excess production) and as a unit of account. After initial discussions of the types and history of money, the course explores financial institutions, different kinds of financial instruments, and the role of our central bank, the Federal Reserve. Questions the course answers include: How can policy and institutions create or moderate business cycles? How does monetary policy effect inflation and economic growth? How does international trade and foreign currency exchange impact these things?

It is seen as the best form of government to achieve the modern aspirations of political equality, liberty, and autonomy for all. However, there is also a growing skepticism towards democracy. For example, we can hear ordinary citizens complain about how democracies are elite governments, not delivering the promise of equal power. Decreasing electoral participation in western democracies are taken as a sign of the declining confidence in democracy. Furthermore, with the recent rise of autocratic and populist leaders, some commentators are increasingly raising one of the oldest criticisms against democracy: democracy is a dangerous form of rule, prone to divisive, tyrannical, or despotic governments. Thus, this contemporary condition invites many questions: what is democracy and why should we champion it? Does democratic decision-making result in good outcomes or governments? Are current democratic regimes actually organized around the core democratic values? Is the idea of democratic self-rule achievable in modern societies? \n\nThis course will trace the idea of democracy with a particular attention to its defenders and its critiques throughout the history of political thought. In light of these competing arguments, we will also examine current public debates that make explicit appeals to democracy or democratic values.

We will discuss the history of psychology beginning with an overview of psychology's roots, observing how prevailing paradigms have shifted throughout the centuries. We'll then discuss how to think like a social scientist, with an attitude of open mindedness and skepticism, as we observe people in different social settings. Discussion will include the tools and methods that are used by social scientists to formulate their questions and propose answers. With the tools of neuroscience we will explore the biological underpinnings of mind and emotions and how they influence behavior. We will seek to understand and have empathy with individuals suffering from psychological disorders ranging from mild depression to severe psychosis. Discussion will cover ways to diagnose psychopathology and therapies that have been proposed to heal such internal suffering. Practical skills for coping with stress and emotions will also be explored.

Students will learn a theoretical and conceptual vocabulary for describing and making sense of organizational culture, dysfunction, and the broader institutional contexts that shape organizational life. \n\nIn terms of course expectations, the emphasis is on reading and writing about sociological and historical organizational theory at an introductory to intermediate level, and students will be encouraged to apply course material to experience from their everyday lives.\n\nThis course combines classroom lecture and discussion with an online component in a five-week intensive format. In-class sessions will be held on 1/12, 1/26, 2/9, 2/23, and 3/9. This course is part of the Business Leadership year two cohort. First class attendance is mandatory.",

This is the result of a dramatic increase in the rate of incarceration over the past 40 years, during which crime rates first rose significantly, but then fell to historic lows. This begs the question: what is the relationship between crime and punishment? In this class, we will examine the political, legal, and social factors that have shaped our perceptions of and responses to crime. We will ask why certain crimes receive significant attention from law enforcement while others do not, and investigate some of the individual and organizational actors involved in defining contemporary \"crime problems\" and their solutions. Throughout, we will pay particular attention to the relationships among crime, punishment, and the production of social inequality, highlighting implicit and explicit biases in the criminal justice system while noting where intent and outcome may diverge. The course format will be a discussion-based seminar. Students will be required to give one class presentation and conduct a court observation.

Emerging from an early career in music video (where he directed artists like Madonna, Paula Abdul, and Billy Idol), Fincher has gone on to apply his slick visual style, gritty aesthetic, and panache for exploring the dark side of human nature to his work as a film and television director as well. Examining works such as Se7en (1995), Fight Club (1999), Zodiac (2007), The Social Network (2010), The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011), Gone Girl (2016), and Mindhunter (2017- ), as well as examples from Fincher's directorial work in music video and commercial advertising, this course will trace markers of Fincher's stylistic, structural, and thematic imprint throughout his oeuvre, in order to explore how artistic signature is expressed and developed across various media forms. Drawing on the origins and history of cinematic auteur theory as it was popularized by the Cahiers critics during the French New Wave and adapted to describe certain filmmakers within the New Hollywood movement of the 1970s, students will be asked to consider how film authorship currently functions in a contemporary film industry dominated by spin-offs, sequels, and franchises. In addition, through screenings, discussions, and written assignments, students will have the opportunity to share their ideas about authorship in the contemporary mediascape, hone their critical analysis skills, and enhance their overall understanding of film, television, and video as artistic and ideological vehicles, as well as objects of critical inquiry.

As such, we will consider the category of monstrosity in relation to categories of difference including gender, race, sexuality, and disability. Monsters occupy liminal spaces and threaten the conventional cultural boundaries and categories (for example, normal/deviant, natural/supernatural, primitive/civilized, male/female, human/nonhuman).

The question of who enjoys the rights of a citizen and who does not has been a pressing cultural and political issue throughout French history. Despite the republican ideals of citizenship proclaimed by the French Revolution, residents of the French Empire and its former colonies in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were divided by unequal legal statuses. This course studies cultural representations in French of this fundamental question of belonging. We will see how film, visual arts, and fiction and non-fiction writing in French has raised the issue of citizenship in debates over slavery in Revolutionary France, the unequal legal statuses of French colonial subjects in Africa and the Caribbean, and the challenging conditions that immigrants often face in contemporary France.

At the center of the polemic were the questions of reading, of teleology, of destiny, and of signification. In other words, the ways in which crime, detecting, the law, and meaning circulate in this story made for a fertile ground for thinking literature and the enterprise of interpretation. The debate is revealing not only because of the ways in which each theorist reads the short story but also how each reads the other's reading and engages with its implications. In this course, we will begin by reading the texts of this polemic together with Poe's story as a kind of portal that will orient us in our own acts of reading as we make our way through a number of works by Francophone writers from Africa. Our readings will by no means be limited by the terms of this debate, nor will we merely apply its conceptual framework to them. Instead, we will allow the debate to provide us with a certain vocabulary as well as the opening questions that we will then pursue through the vicissitudes of each literary works.

But it was not just humans who caressed, cross-dressed, or undressed in the natural environs of early modern poetry and drama; nature itself could be read as fundamentally sexual, often radically so. In this course, students will learn the essential skills of ecocriticism in order to explore both how humans' \"natural\" sexualities were refracted through their environment and how nature's own eroticism could reflect, subvert, or exceed human patterns of gender and sexuality. What, for instance, was John Donne thinking when he expressed his desire through the flea, an animal that Renaissance zoologists didn't even think reproduced sexually? Why was the sea getting handsy with Leander as he swam through it in Christopher Marlowe's most famous poem? And were queen bees actually king bees, Renaissance entomologists wondered, or were queen bees just cross-dressing with that sword-like stinger?

Prerequisites are completion of a core sequence of courses on Western music history or previous course work in film, theater, or comparative literary studies. Our focus will be a group of operas from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries which were based on pre-existing literary or theatrical works, and which, in turn, inspired cinematic or televised works in the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries. In each case, we will study the literary or theatrical inspiration in its own right (those who can are encouraged to read these classic works in their original languages), become familiar with the opera, and proceed to some famous films and other video adaptations of each opera. We will end the course with a popular film that is directly based on neither a literary original nor an opera, but relies strongly on conventions from both and features a performance of one of our featured operas.",

When observers discuss the effects of globalization, they may refer to any of a number of its different facets: economic, political, social, and environmental. In this course we will focus primarily on economic globalization - the increase in the cross-border flows of goods and services, workers, firms, and money. This course is intended to take stock of globalization in light of the global economic meltdown. What is globalization? Are its effects on the economic fortunes of individuals in wealthy democracies different than in developing countries? Does the reduction of barriers to economic exchange harm national cultures? Is terrorism linked to globalization? Does globalization erode or enhance American military power? Has globalization gone too far - or has it not gone far enough? These are the kinds of questions that will be discussed in the course. The course is organized around six major topics: (1) conceptualizing globalization; (2) assessing the constituent parts of economic globalization (trade, finance, multinational production, and immigration); (3) how different national styles of capitalism in the advanced industrial countries have adjusted to pressure from rising economic globalism; (4) how developing countries joined the globalization bandwagon and whether global economic inequality has increased or decreased as a result; (5) the consequences of increasing economic integration for distinct national cultures; (6) the challenges to globalization posed by transnational terrorism, geopolitical rivalries, and the series of economic crises after 2008.",

Through a team-based approach to learning, we will explore how, why, and when the international community is able to overcome collective action problems and effectively address global environmental challenges. \n\nThe course is divided into three parts. In the first part of the course, we will focus on the problems, institutions, and politics in global environmental governance. The second part of the course focuses on key concepts or themes in global environmental politics that shape our understanding of international cooperation in solving environmental problems, such as science, justice, markets, and security. In the third part of the course, students will participate in an extended negotiation simulation to examine the diverse actors and modes of engagement that define the politics around a particular issue.",

Also, we will study how these issues shape the experiences of social group members, especially when they are members of low-status and/or minority groups.  In order to explore these topics, we will primarily focus on large societal groups that differ on dimensions of identity such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and religion.  Rather than relying on anecdotal evidence, cultural truisms, or philosophical orientations to address these issues, we will approach these issues wearing the hat of an experimental social psychologist.  That is, we will examine traditional and contemporary theories of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination, punctuated by empirical findings.  Finally, we will apply the theoretical and empirical work to current events and issues.",

    "overview": "This survey course will introduce students to over two hundred years of the history of South Asia - home to nearly one-fourth of the world's population today - and South Asian communities. From the mid-eighteenth century to the present, South Asia has witnessed multiple political transitions - from Mughal sovereignty to British colonial rule, from British authority to post-colonial nation-building, and the creation of new territorial nation-states. Dilemmas rooted in histories of imperialism haunt South Asian nation-states and South Asian communities living in Europe, the United States, and other parts of the world today. In this course, we will examine a range of themes and issues related to this diverse region and its complex histories. How did the British state consolidate political control in this region? How did colonial authority transform during these centuries? How did British Indians challenge the many edifices of imperialism and wrest political independence in 1947? What is the place of imperialism in the creation and evolution of diasporic South Asian communities? In addition, we will reflect on socio-political movements that sought to redress gender and caste inequality and investigate their fraught relationship with the colonial state, anti-colonial nationalism, and the ongoing project of post-colonial nation-making. Key themes include: ideologies and practices of imperialism; anti-colonial nationalisms and their challenges; processes of post-colonial nation-making; South Asian diasporas in colonial and post-colonial eras; nationalisms, languages, religions, gender, caste, and class. In course of investigating these themes, we will run into a range of key figures and events: Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain and Sayyid Ahmad Khan; Gandhi, Jinnah, Nehru, and Ambedkar; World Wars and South Asian men; Partition, and communal violence; Indira Gandhi, Zia al-Huq, and Benazir Bhutto.",

What are the different kinds of racial injustice that we can identify, and the different kinds of exclusion, subordination, marginalization and stigmatization that can be part of racial oppression? How should racial oppression be resisted? How should racial violence be stopped? How should we build racial solidarity and fight for racial justice?

We will take up the literature on transnationalism and examine the social mechanisms that make it possible for immigrants to maintain close ties with their countries of origin while simultaneously participating in the social life of their new locations. We will link migration to a wide range of related issues, including the global circulation of culture and economic resources, the growing facility of international travel and the barriers imposed by international borders, the technological innovations that facilitate instant contact with far-away places, and the global dissemination of information. Finally, we will discuss these various issues in the broader context of shifting U.S. immigration policies and politics.",

Guiding questions for the investigation are: What is a late style' as discussed by Walter Benjamin, Theodor W. Adorno, Hans Blumenberg, and Edward Said? How does Goethe fit into the changing cultural understanding of time structures around 1800? Was he nave or sentimental? How did the notion of \"World Literature\" emerge? What is Goethean science? All these questions can only properly addressed by looking at Goethe's writings through the lens of his intense philosophical reception in the early 20th century (Simmel, Rosenzweig, Cassirer, Kommerell).",

    "overview": "\"Queer theory\" and \"New Queer Cinema\" were two neologisms born of the same early-1990s moment in Anglophone academia, artistry, and activism. Both saw themselves as extending but also complicating the intellectual, aesthetic, and ideological parameters of prior formations like \"gay and lesbian studies\" or \"LGBT film.\" These new and spreading discourses stoked each other's productive advances. Scholars developed and illustrated new axioms through the medium of the movies, while filmmakers rooted their stories and images in changing notions of gender performativity, counter-historiography, and coalitional politics. Still, queer theory and queer cinema faced similar skepticisms: did their ornate language and conceptual novelty endow dissident sexualities with newfound political, cultural, and philosophical stature, or did they retreat too far from daily lives, mainstream tastes, and ongoing public emergencies? Did \"queer\" enable elastic identification and coalition among subjects with a wide range of sexual and gendered identities, or did the term reproduce the demographic and discursive hierarchies it claimed to deconstruct? Was the lack of fixed definitions, consensus ideals, or shared aesthetic practices a boon or a harm in sustaining a long-term movement of art, action, or thought?\n\nThis class will explore some decisive shifts as critical theory and narrative film reclaimed \"queer\" as a boundary-breaking paradigm, in the pivotal era of Gender Trouble, Epistemology of the Closet, Tongues Untied, and Paris Is Burning. We will recover scholarly and cinematic trends that laid indispensable groundwork for these queer turns and will also track the subsequent careers of \"queer\" in the way we perform readings, perceive bodies, record histories, imagine psyches, form alliances, enter archives, and orient ourselves in space and time. Diversities of race, class, and gender identity will constantly inflect our understandings of \"queer\" and even challenge the presumed primacy of sexuality as the key referent for that term. Participants will develop skills of close-reading films as films and engage nimbly with the overarching claims but also the curious nuances, anomalies, and paradoxes in the scholarship we read. (This seminar satisfies a core requirement toward the Graduate Certificate in Gender & Sexuality Studies.)",

Analyzing a variety of works of media addressing environmental themes, including works drawn from advertising and marketing, we will consider different types of environmental messaging and attempts to mobilize public moral engagement. Specifically, we will be looking at strategies for implementing media interventions as moral interventions. Discussion taken up in this class will include evaluating the comparative value of media messaging that emphasizes individual action and personal responsibility, versus messaging that promotes collective action, policy, and structural changes. Students will consider and debate what constitutes authentic \"green\" messaging versus mere corporate \"greenwashing.\" Throughout, we will ask what kind of media we need in what has been called the \"Anthropocene\" (a time when humans are now a major geologic force affecting the future of the planet). When motivating public moral engagement in climate crisis, are the solutions being offered those that the planet will actually \"register\" or \"notice\" on a global scale? If not, what kinds of \"media interventions\" do we need to be making and how? Course content will include discussion of media interventions as moral interventions, media directed at social change, eco-media responses by religious communities and organizations, participatory digital culture, and the challenges of addressing environmental crisis in the distraction economy and what has been called the \"post-truth era.\" Students will have the opportunity to propose and craft their own environmental media interventions as the course's final project.",

If ethics should matter, then how should ethical concerns be factored in to state and individual decision-making? Are there universal moral standards that governments should re-spect? Is there an \"international society\" to whom leaders should be accountable? What should our indi-vidual responsibility be in ensuring ethical political relations at the international level, as political leaders, members of businesses, and as individual citizens?  \n\nThis course is designed to challenge you to make decisions about the role ethics should play in interna-tional affairs. We explore a handful of ethical frameworks, which can serve as launchpads for thinking about the role of ethics in international affairs.

At its core, the goal of genomics is to generate a detailed map of an organism's genome that includes the location and identity of every gene. However, the field of genomics is becoming increasingly broad, often focusing on the questions and analyses that arise once a genome has been sequenced and described. The methods developed by the Human Genome Project, both from a sequencing and analysis perspective, significantly altered the landscape of human research, both from a biomedical and from an evolutionary standpoint. Building on these methods and on very recent advances in DNA sequencing technology, genomics is no longer limited to the study of humans; genome research can now being applied to any organism from jellyfish to polar bear, from mold to palm trees. In this class we will discuss how and why we sequence genomes, how we analyze their content (including a hands-on approach), and how the understanding of genomes from across the entire tree of life (i.e., comparative genomics) can illuminate fundamental questions in biology.",

The course will provide an introduction to the major theoretical frameworks that guide anthropological approaches to studying human health-related behavior. Theory will be combined with case studies from a number of societies, from India, Japan, Brazil, and Haiti to the U.S. and Canada, enabling students to identify similarities across seemingly disparate cultural systems, while at the same time demonstrating the ways in which American health behaviors and practices are socially embedded and culturally specific.

The course will attend to the\nintellectual and political history informing Foucault's critiques of, and elaborations on, the\ndiscourse of sovereignty, including legal discourses. During class meetings we will discuss\nFoucault's historical periodizations of changing discourses of power/knowledge relations\nassociated with biopolitics and evaluate the metanarrative that informs his heuristics. Lectures\nwill discuss the readings in the context of Foucault's own intellectual history. The class will\nread extensively from works by Foucault as well as texts by Giorgio Agamben, Judith Butler,\nNancy Fraser, Bruno Perreau, Jacques Rancire, Ann Stoler, and others. You are encouraged\nreflect on how the weekly assignments are in conversation with your own research interests.

Our course will show students how to think historically - examining works with cultural resonance in mind, and as historical documents themselves rich in discourses about gender, race, politics and social difference - while also considering how media works are embedded in unique industrial processes of production and distribution.

    "overview": "Algorithms, or, more broadly, systems driven by computational actors, are everywhere, and right now we're all trying to figure out just how much influence they do (and should) have over our lives. It seems like a new question, but it can also be seen as an extension of a debate that's been raging about computers specifically since the 1950s and technology in general since a very dangerous external memory technology known as \"writing\" debuted. The latest iteration of this debate involves all computerized decision making and content recommendation systems, from Facebook's News Feed to search engine results that determine what is or is not \"true\" for a large portion of the world. We're in a synthesis with these computational actors, for better or worse, and understanding them is a huge step towards understanding the modern world on a deeper level. This course is a tour through the three-way interplay between algorithmically-driven systems, individual human experience and values, and large-scale social structures. We will start broad and philosophical, then take a deep dive to highlight direct impacts on daily life and dispel some of the key myths that surround these technological interlocutors. Along the way, in keeping with the mission of the junior writing seminar, we will deconstruct key articles the literature to identify what makes \"good academic writing.\" This will culminate in your own 20-page research proposal. We will take the explicit position that there is, in fact, no such thing as \"good writing\" - only low-fidelity drafting, an openness to feedback, and a passion for editing. As such, our focus will be on getting ideas on paper, and then helping each other iterate and turn these ideas into a solid written foundation for scientific inquiry through workshopping and in-depth feedback.",

It combines classic theory and research with some of the most current empirical work available. It is divided into three sections. The first section introduces research on intergenerational social mobility - describing just how much mobility exists in the United States, how it has changed over time, and how much education might mediate social mobility.  The second section considers four competing theories that describe how and why education mediates the intergenerational inheritance of social status.  The final section examines policies designed to promote social mobility, reduce racial and SES-based achievement gaps, and \"break the cycle of poverty\" through education.",

They key to Heidegger's paradigm shift is the generalization of hermeneutics from a traditional method for interpreting authoritative texts to a way of understanding human beings themselves. The hermeneutic paradigm offers a radically different understanding of what is distinctive about human beings: to be human is not primarily to be a rational animal, but first and foremost to be a self-interpreting animal. In order to assess the explanatory power of hermeneutic philosophy, our seminar will undertake three tasks. First, we will analyze Being and Time's hermeneutic conception of human identity and its main philosophical consequences. To get a sense of the full explanatory potential of Heidegger's hermeneutics we will then analyze Gadamer's dialogical approach to interpretation as elaborated in his Truth and Method as well as contemporary accounts that directly engage with it, like those of Brandom, Dworkin, and Habermas. Third, we will explore the potential limits of hermeneutic philosophy through an analysis of challenging approaches such as Marx's critique of ideology, feminism, and critical race theory. Engaging with the Gadamer/Habermas debate will also help us assess the possibilities of articulating a critical hermeneutics along the lines of Habermas's democratic turn' in critical theory.",

Is belief in the possibility of grace necessary for a consistent moral life, or does it undermine moral responsibility?

It will begin with Japan's great transition in 1868 from a feudal, isolated society, move to its emergence as a modern state integrated into the world political economy, and march on to the disaster of WWII.  In 1860, the Japanese were born to their status, ruled by a shogun, and cut off from nearly all contact with the outside world.  By 1905, Japan had become a modern industrial nation with imperial possessions.  By 1941, its leaders decided they had no other choice than to gamble their resources and achievements in what would prove to be a devastating war.  These wrenching transitions led to considerable accomplishments but also to enormous tension and discontent.  The course will examine both of these dimensions, looking at Japan's imperialist adventures in Asia as well as the rural and urban domestic experience.  The course will introduce students to the major English-language works and central debates in the field.  Students will read a few texts in common but mainly choose others in consultation with the professor, based on individual interests (e.g. diplomatic history, economic history, history of childhood).  Students from disciplines other than History are welcome.",

The classical writings of Peirce, James, Dewey set the stage for a completely new orientation in epistemology, moral and political theory, psychology and many other fields. Basic to all Pragmatist writers is the belief that the active and interactive human being in its natural and social environment has to stand at the center of reflection. They thus emphasize volitional, procedural, social, and evolutionary aspects of knowledge of any kind. Given this focus on practically involved intelligent agents, political pragmatists like Dewey, Addams, Locke explore the natural origins, revisability and legitimacy of moral and political norms. They develop the idea of a critical use of knowledge and its connection to non-violent democratic conduct. Neopragmatists (Rorty and Putnam) explore the philosophical and political implications of critical thinking.",

For years, the supply of lawyers has vastly outstripped the demand for legal jobs and the resulting lawyer bubble has grown.  Meanwhile, those who land law jobs have different challenges: recent surveys report many attorneys' growing disenchantment with their work and dissatisfaction with their lives. This seminar will examine the profession's multidimensional crisis. What changes occur in attorneys, both individually and systemically, emerging from law schools and finding their roles in the legal realm? Why is working within the most lucrative big firms now regarded by many as the pinnacle of private practice? What other options are available?  It will explore life after law school, examining the disparate places law graduates might find themselves.  The course invites prospective law students to consider their potential places, as individual lawyers, in what remains a noble profession.  It also invites those students in other undergraduate disciplines who may be curious about trajectories open to them in this post-graduate academic and, ultimately, career field.",

Graphs, at their most abstract, provide a language for describing relationships, one which has long been beneficial for the program of physical prediction. Combined with the Wilsonian understanding of effective field theory, perturbative analysis finds a role in predictions relevant to all scales, from processes describing the scattering of primordial gravitons, to QCD interactions at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, to establishing the astrophysical in-spiral and consequent post-merger ringing out of black holes, to the evolution of the largest scales cosmologically conceivable. Modern advances in scattering amplitude calculation have reemphasized the role of graphical organization towards efficient prediction, generalizing away from brute Feynman diagram calculation, but yielding structural insights suggestive of a new type of unification touching predictions relevant to all of these scales.\n\nIn these lectures I will talk about graphical organization of perturbative prediction, emphasizing scattering amplitudes, but with an eye towards generalization.\n\n\t SPINOR HELICITY in 4D, sailing by the light of the little group to discover efficient variables for 4D prediction.\n\n\t ON-SHELL SUPERSYMMETRY for fun and profit, a symmetric playground for gently testing ideas and strategies towards predictive universality touching everything from scalars through gravitons.\n\n\t COLOR-KINEMATICS (\"BCJ\") DUALITY AND ASSOCIATED DOUBLE-COPY.

We open with a question that animates the entire course: what is \"the body,\" and how do we know? In the first two weeks, we grapple with the dramatically different ways ancient Chinese and Greek medical traditions (respectively) viewed, touched, and diagnosed the body, seeking to understand how the body has been differently \"constructed\" as an object of knowledge in different parts of the world. Then we broaden our purview to examine how, over the course of Chinese history, the body was closely bound up with ethics; the aspiration to immortality; governance and cosmology; and human interactions with gods and demons (while also looping back to medicine several times). We conclude with two case studies of religion and the body in contemporary China, one situated on the southwestern periphery of the PRC, the other in the capital city of Beijing. Throughout the quarter our attention will move between Buddhist, Daoist, and Confucian traditions, but we will rarely be bounded by these categories. Instead, thematic focus on the body provides a lens through which to see how religion in China routinely breaches such neatly-demarcated categories. By the course's end, students will gain important resources for understanding historical and contemporary Chinese culture, and new perspectives on what it means to be religious and embodied.",

Could one reconcile concrete reality (or realism) with faith in the other-worldly?  Many of the artists under discussion in the course drew upon themes that had already been raised by Kierkegaard in the 19th century.  What was the relationship between religion and modernity, faith and ethics, reality and the supernatural, observable phenomena and invisible causes?  How did one make sense of death in a meaningless universe?  Was the universe meaningless?  Could meaning be found in realism itself? \n\nThrough engagement with films by directors ranging from Robert Bresson, Luis Buuel, Pier Paolo Pasolini, and Ingmar Bergman, to Woody Allen and Harold Ramis, we will study mid-to-late 20th century films whose common theme is the quest to understand the meaning of life, either actively through taking up religious life, or because the protagonists consider themselves inhabiting a godless and meaningless universe.   Class will be discussion-based, with a few short lectures to set up pertinent themes.  Our discussions will likely range broadly, but important themes will be realism, existentialism, atheism, and the quest for philosophical truth to be found in filmic portrayals of everyday life.  Class readings will include Kierkegaard, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, among others.\n\nPlease send a short note to Professor Molina (molina@northwestern.edu) to request permission to enroll.

The second section of the course considers the role of Foucauldian biopolitics within a number of debates from contemporary gender, queer and race studies. Topics will be selected from: politics of utopianism, futurism, the anti-social thesis, critique of reproductive futurism, necropolitics and afro-pessimism, cruel optimism, social ontology and precarious life, debility, biopolitics and the management of language, and the politics of plural temporalities.",

Why does Blackness still persist despite these challenges? How is this category continually reconstituted through social, economic, cultural, legal, political, etc. discourses and institutions? Drawing on theoretical discourses from the social sciences and humanities, the course surveys Blackness as a global category of critical analysis for both historical and contemporary social formations in the African Diaspora. In addition, by considering the different manifestations of Blackness as well as other forms of racialized identity across the globe from historical, empirical, and theoretical perspectives, it also considers how gender, class, sexuality, and nationality shape the territories of Blackness. We will study scholarly works that address, on the one hand, the continued significance of slavery, colonialism, incarceration, segregation, other forms of racialized violence, and, on the other hand, texts that imagine future forms of Blackness.",

But all of these endeavors, though often entered into with the best of intentions, are beset with ethical questions, concerns, and dilemmas, and can have unintended consequences. In this course, students will assess these ethical challenges. In so doing, students will examine core ethical codes, guidelines, and principals - such as solidarity, social justice, and humility - so they will be able to ethically assess global health practices in a way that places an emphasis on the core goal of global health: reducing health inequities and disparities.",

The course will cover topics as various as migration and globalization; gender, sexuality, and kinship; race and ethnicity; economics and politics; language, art, and religion. By reading the results of anthropological research conducted all over the world, students will gain the analytical skills necessary to investigate the cultural worlds they encounter on a daily basis right here in Chicago. They will develop an appreciation for human cultural diversity, along with a nuanced understanding of global and local inequalities as they are experienced by various groups of people.

Readings will include short formspersonal essays, narrative essays, food writing, reviews, longform journalism, and interviews and profiles. We'll also examine the potential that book-length forms offer, e.g., memoirs. You'll complete weekly assignments, continue or embark on a work-in-progress, and submit a final piece of writing that's been revised, edited, and proofread. We'll discuss publishing opportunities and go over the submission process, including how to choose websites and journals to submit to, write email queries and cover letters, and pitch reviews and features.",

Geometric interpretations of linear transformations in Euclidean n-spaces will be discussed through the introduction of determinants, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. The last part of the course will be open-ended. Each student will choose a topic related to an application of linear algebra to statistics, engineering, or another field of mathematics, and give an expository presentation in the last class meeting. This course focuses on problem-solving techniques in mathematics. A significant part of the lecture time will be devoted to small group discussions for problem solving.",

This class explores the discourses and practices that make up volunteering and voluntourism, from the perspectives of volunteers, hosts, and a range of professional practitioners both promoting and critiquing this apparent rise in \"the need to help\". What boons and burdens occur with the boom of volunteer fervor world-wide? Why do people feel the need to volunteer, and what consequences do these voluntary exchanges have on the volunteers, and on those communities and institutions that are subject to their good intentions? What are the ethics and values that make up \"making a difference\" among differently-situated players who are involved in volunteering? Given that volunteers often act upon best intentions, what are the logics that justify philanthropy and the differential standards by which volunteers are judged based on where they go and how they engage in volunteering? This class seeks out some answers to these questions, highlighting the need go beyond the adage \"any help is better than no help at all\", and instead bring critical thinking to best intentions.",

Contemporary theodicies come no closer to explaining away the existence of evil than Augustine did in his exploration of the question of God as the cause of evil as well as good, the creator of the serpent in the garden, the tempter to the Fall. Augustine began his defense of God by bringing several assumptions to the table: that there is a God, that God is all-good, all-powerful and all-knowing and that there is a divine order to the universe. Contemporary \"explorers\" of the subject, like Wendy Farley, Arthur McGill, Tyron Inbody, Dorothee Soelle and Gustavo Gutierrez, to name only a few, operate from these same assumptions and, while their approaches differ, all end with the same frustrating non-answer to the primary question: Is God responsible for evil and for the suffering in the universe? This course probes this question, but also looks at others: How do you account for the Good in the world? Would we know good if we did not have evil? Can you have Good without God?

We will focus on his attempts to limit the claims of reason, specifically to show that traditional, philosophical metaphysics is an enterprise bound to fail because it transcends human cognitive capacities. Specifically, we will read and discuss Kant's arguments that we cannot rationally prove the existence of God or the immortality of the soul, that we cannot rationally establish the finitude (or not) of the world, the ultimate components of reality, or the reality (or not) of free will. These arguments are Kant's most decisively influential and the most controversial in his time, earning him the title of the \"great destroyer.\"  And yet Kant is not entirely critical of these aspirations of reason: we will also discuss Kant's diagnosis of these metaphysical arguments as natural, inevitable temptations of human reason, and his suggestions concerning the positive uses of reason - despite these criticisms - in both science and morality. Our most general topic for discussion is, then, Kant's conception of the nature of human reason: as striving beyond the fact of the matter, beyond us, beyond itself, both beneficially and problematically, and as capable of self-limitation.",

Why is a large vocabulary important for second language acquisition? A large and robust vocabulary is one of the most important indicators of language proficiency in general, and reading proficiency in particular.  As a matter of fact, student achievement can be explained as much by vocabulary size as by academic ability, even in the first language. In order for students to advance in their foreign language proficiency to a C1 level on the CEFR scale (or an advanced level on the ACTFL proficiency scale)  it is estimated that learners need to acquire at least 1,000 base words per year to reach the 4000-5000 base words necessary for comprehension of authentic sources and literary texts. The goal of this course is to encourage and facilitate the review and acquisition of intermediate- and advanced-level vocabulary items in German through explicit vocabulary instruction which aims at engaging students in actively thinking about word meanings, the relationships among words, and how we can use words in different situations.  Short reading, writing, speaking and listing exercises will help students refine vocabulary depth which includes learning about grammar constructions and collocations, connotations, register, and style. Studying words directly will improve vocabulary breadth, which refers to the understanding of meaning in various contexts.  Students will study and commit words to memory through a variety  of well-established activities including researching learning opportunities through technology as well as understanding and working with google translate.",

    "overview": "How did France become a secular republic whereas it began as a divine-right monarchy? What did it take to uproot centuries of tradition, cultural values, social hierarchy, and the established political order France shared with the rest of Europe, virtually overnight? In this course, we examine the ideas, cultural practices, and symbols that shaped the most radical social, cultural, and political transformation in the history of France and the Francophone world. Changing the course of France and its colonies, the French Revolution drew on a powerful new understanding of \"man\" in order to reinvent or throw out entirely age-old notions of sovereignty, the law, God, religion, time, the calendar, the nation, and the family. Crucial to the Revolution's contagious force were the widely consumed texts, images, songs, and spectacles that arguably made it the first mass cultural phenomenon in French history. Beginning with the central philosophical ideas that informed the political challenge to absolute monarchy, we proceed to survey some of the revolution's most significant cultural achievements. These include the emergence of a free press, the birth of human rights, the rise of popular political activism, secularism and the reinvention of religion, the re-constitution of time, the rise of new forms of theatricality and public performance, and a number of lasting symbols such as Marianne, the Bastille, and the Marseillaise. At the same time, we consider the extent to which violence, war, surveillance, terror, colonialism, and aspects of republican ideology itself introduced dangers and threatened the revolution's most cherished gains. We conclude with a consideration of the contemporary antislavery revolution in colonial Haiti, which in many ways exceeded the radicalism of the French Revolution. Throughout the course, we reflect on the legacy of revolutionary changes in our world today. Works by Rousseau, Sieys, Marat, De Lisle, Robespierre, Maurin De Pompigny, Dessalines, and others.",

How can we realize human rights and secure civil rights in our communities and around the world? We will attempt to answer these questions by exploring specific steps of the design and implementation process. By examining characteristics of youth and community programs in the fields of education, social justice, human development, health promotion, human rights, and civic engagement - at the local, national, and international levels - we will seek to identify commonalities and understand differences among them.\n\nA key goal of this course is to acquire an intellectual and applied understanding of the principles of program design and development, which include a sustained consideration of issues affecting the quality of program implementation. Considerable attention will be devoted to specific steps within the design and implementation process, as well as case studies of actual programs. We will examine a range of topics, including: finding inspiration; identification, recruitment, and retention of target audiences; staff selection; setting global and incremental goals; and ensuring sustainability. We must also acknowledge that what counts as a social need or social problem is subjective and complex and that programs can therefore be controversial, difficult to manage, and difficult to evaluate. In light of this, we will touch on the organizational, ethical, and political contexts of implementation.\n\nWhile much of the design and implementation process can be seen as intuitive, you are encouraged - through class discussion, your writing, and your designs - to actively challenge your assumptions about creating community programming, as well as critique the programs that we learn about and the design techniques that we practice.",

A key question is how these variations are produced and reproduced, whether we speak of society (subsistence, ideas) or individuals (biology, psychology, social identity). Conversely, what happens when reproduction fails to occur, or does so when and how it should not. Because reproduction is so strongly associated with biology in our society, viewing it through a cultural lens poses significant challenges to some of our most basic tenets. Tensions arise in questions of agency vs. control, nature vs. culture, identity construction, reproducing under varying conditions, and so on. The study of reproduction, therefore, offers a window into the heart of anthropology itself. The goals of this course are (1) to expose students to just a few of the many sociocultural approaches to reproduction by ranging broadly across topics, time, and place; and (2) to identify and evaluate concepts and theories embedded in writings on the dynamics of reproduction. While the concept of \"reproduction\" can refer to societal reproduction, emphasis will be on the reproduction of children. To this end, possible topics may include fostering/adoption, AIDS orphans, fatherhood, technologies of fertility control, assisted reproduction, obstetrics, gender imbalances in Asia, debates over abortion, etc.",

    "overview": "This course addresses the social construction of masculinity from a global and comparative perspective. Masculinity as an academic concept refers to more than traditional \"manliness\" or virility. The term also mediates gendered relations among men, between men and women, and among subjects who do or do not subscribe to fixed or binary understandings of gender. Thus, the first goal of this course is to deconstruct the term \"men\" as a universal and undifferentiated category and to spotlight the diverse dimensions of men's lives. The second objective of this seminar is to contest a singular and Western-centered paradigm to understand man, maleness, and masculinity. Across various cultures, there are different cultural codes to define an ideal man. Who is considered masculine? What kind of attributes or behavior are regarded as masculine? By whom? What sort of men possess power and, conversely, what forms of power construct \"men\" as a category or are presumed to flow naturally or directly from masculinity? Cross-cultural experiences among men offer more than one answer to these questions. Thus, throughout the quarter, we will address scholarship focusing on Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, Latin America, and North America. That said, the class is not organized around separate \"units\" based in specific geographies. Instead, each section of the course devotes itself to a particular concept or question elated to masculinity and will comprise readings addressing different locales around the world. \n\nIn the first week, this seminar focuses on \"varieties of masculinities\" to contextualize multiple ways to be \"real men\" in distinct cultures. In the following weeks, we explore how other categories shape men's daily lives and the meanings of being men. Readings will shed light on how masculinities intersect with notions of family, class and labor, race, colonialism, health, violence, etc. In the last weeks, since masculinity \"in crisis\" seems to be common cultural phenomena in both Western and non-Western nations, we will shift our focus to discussing why masculinity is precarious and how masculinity has been challenged. Readings will cover topics on female masculinity and male femininity, same-sex relations and masculinities, and new boundaries of masculinity. By the end of the quarter, students are expected to understand similarities and differences of masculinities in distinct cultures.",

Moving across theory and studies in contemporary performance, we will explore the role performance plays in making queer and trans potentiality into an insurgent reality as much as we will engage in the rigorous practice of thinking of queer and trans of color life in an era of unthinking negation.

As in many historical contexts, race and gender interacted dynamically and created the particular context of Nazi-occupied Europe, which was a place where Jewish men and women suffered in particular ways, German men and women participated in particular ways, and other racial groups - men and women alike - were targeted, collaborated, resisted and rescued. We will read a variety of texts that explore the influences that shaped the behavior and response of an array of people during the Holocaust. Racism sat directly in the center of the Nazi world view. Once the Nazis got into power, they sought to translate ideology into policy. Still, their racial policies evolved over time, spurred by opportunism, innovation, and war. And too, Jewish men and women responded in ways similar and divergent to the Nazi onslaught. Sexism was also seemingly an important aspect of the Nazi perspective. While they indeed embraced an anti-feminist stance, the Nazis nevertheless sought to incorporate \"German\" women into the national community and women participated actively in the implementation of Nazi racism.",

This course will trace how and why science fiction in the Americas has emerged as a mode of narration with which to confront contemporary crises. Placing science fiction texts created by Caribbean, Native American, African American, and Latin American artists into conversation with one another, we will explore how these artists turn to stories about zombies and robots, time travel, utopias, and apocalypse (among others) to confront long histories of colonialism, slavery, and racism, and to create speculative or hypothetical futures that posit alternate futures for those histories.  \n\nTo understand what is at stake in imagining alternate worlds and futures for Native, African American, Caribbean, and Latin American writers, we will examine novels, stories, films, graphic novels, video games, and other media and will draw on methodologies from literary and media studies, art history, critical race studies, and more. Questions we will consider include: How does science fiction engage the colonization of the Americas? How do science fiction genres draw on and transform contemporary science, both as a possibility of freedom and to critique a field that has been used to constrain some peoples' freedoms? What alternative Americas do these artists envision, and how do they differ from present or historical realities?

    "requirements": null,
    "overview": "This course is an advanced survey of early modern Western political thought, roughly from the Renaissance (mc15) to just after the French Revolution (lc18). Early modernity is vitally important for the development of political thought in the West because of its dramatic break with classical and medieval modes of thought and because of its articulation of the general concepts and principles which informed subsequent political theories and ideologies of the (later) modern and contemporary periods. We thus witness in early modernity the formation of many of our own ideas and those with which we are rather familiar. But the importance of studying these ideas comes not from their comforting familiarity, but from their unsettling and profound differences, as well. The excitement of studying them comes from their visionary boldness, their palpable urgency, and their creation and reflection of political turbulence and troubles of revolutionary proportions.\n\nThematically, the course will consider concepts and controversies that dominated early modern political thoughtamong them, power, sovereignty, freedom, rights, religion, education, rebellion, revolution, and the state. But it shall emphasize one overarching theme in particular: the monumental transformation in political identity \"from subject to citizen\"and on occasion \"to revolutionary.\" Between the beginning and the end of the early modern period, that is, the dominant political category within which to think of persons or personal identities changed from one of subjection to kings or sovereigns to one of citizenship between formally free persons endowed with equal rights in the state. A subject was one sort of political identity; a citizen quite another. At times, subjects or citizens became revolutionaries, as well. However, while there is a discernible shift over time in early modernity, there is no clear-cut, linear progression. Rather, it is a movement of fits and starts, with reactions and counter-reactionsnot to mention all the hedges. There were different categories of subjects, some more powerful and well placed than others; and there were all manner of exceptions made for those who did not come to count as citizens. At various times and in various theories, women, peoples of color, natives of colonized countries, slaves, servants, and those without land or substantial property were not fully (if at all) citizens. Sometimes they, too, turned into revolutionaries. So, it is a fitful and qualified transformation, with plenty of exceptions made, but monumental all the same. This deserves and will receive close examination and inquiry.\n\nIn studying the transformation \"from subject to citizen, and at times to revolutionaries\"amidst the broader range of political concepts and controversieswe shall spend most of our time studying the (conventionally so-called) great or canonical theorists of early modernityMachiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau. But to understand more deeply these theorists is to understand, in broad outline at least, the political contexts within which they wrote; and it is to consider other political theorists alongside them, like Renaissance Humanists, Protestant Reformers, Divine Right Monarchists, English Revolutionaries (of the 1640s and 1680s), French Revolutionaries (of the 1780s and 90s), and Constitutional Conservatives (like David Hume and Edmund Burke). Our course will end with the \"rights of woman\"as citizenarticulated by Mary Wollstonecraft.",

    "overview": "This course is about violent domestic political conflicts. By the 1970s wars within states, referred to in this class as civil wars, had become the world's dominant form of warfare. These conflicts are notable for their intensities and their durations. Elements of civil wars also appeared in inter-state wars, such as after the American-led attack on Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq in 2003 and against the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001. These wars have involved armed struggles between state forces and rebels over the control of territory and the right to form the central government. But armed actors in civil wars reflect many agendas and include ethnic militias, vigilante groups, foreign mercenaries, and criminal gangs. A key observation in this course, however, is that these multiple agendas and complex dynamics\"wars within wars\"play more important roles in recent and ongoing civil wars. This development stands in contrast to civil wars through the mid-20th century. Though these wars also included complex arrays of armed groups and agenda, they tended to feature more clear-cut distinctions between state and rebel combatants. The causes and significance of this change will constitute one of the themes of this course.\nThe first segment of this course will consider several academic theories about the causes of civil wars. These theories range from the economist's analysis that an abundance of natural resources and other economic opportunities provide incentives for rebellion to enterprising individuals, to the idea derived from international relations that \"security dilemmas\" (mutual fears that one's neighbors are preparing to strike) cause civil wars, and to the investigation of how changes in the global structure of economies and politics are at the roots of many civil wars. The second segment of this course will focus on the processes of war fighting in civil wars. Students will find that the explanations of causes of civil wars, while of varying applicability from one case to the next, prove to be quite valuable in terms of generating questions and in turning attention to particular kinds of relationships. This section will focus on processes such as the rise of leaders, the formulation of ideologies and political programs (or their absence), and recruitment of fighters and supporters. In a third section we will consider the special role of violence in influencing the courses of these other processes and relationships.",

    "overview": "Social justice is often defined as the just and equal access to resources, privileges, and social status, and involves the recognition of persistent social inequalities, and that work toward social justice involves ongoing structural social change.  This course examines social justice as idea and process, in historical perspective and around the world, and through the lens of active social justice movements in Chicago today.  We look in particular at the Black Lives Matter movement, struggles against urban gentrification and displacement, and the immigrant rights movement, as case studies offering new internship opportunities.  Course readings and meetings emphasize reflection, debate, and constructive critique, as we pay attention to the intersections of race, class, gender, citizenship, and sexuality, but focus especially on the discourses and practices of race and racism that frame social justice struggles.",

We will focus on user experience, human emotion, form and the use of materials in design and develop multiple concepts across a range of industries. We will also imagine and develop ideas at a range of scales, from handheld products, to large architectural installations. We will also work to develop your unique sketching style and aesthetic.\n \nWe will work in a studio culture involving a fast-paced work environment, peer-review, and an opportunity to learn from a wide variety of resources. Reading and exercises will be provided on a project-by-project basis and you will also be encouraged to explore other types of visual communication that you find interesting in the development of concepts.",

We will examine the interactions of plants with other groups of organisms, such as with pollinators and ant \"bodyguards\", and how plants play a fundamental role in the ecosystem. We will also discuss adaptations that plant groups have evolved for living in extreme environments, including deserts and mountain tops, as well as adaptations in carnivorous and parasitic plants.

The book investigates the notion of  responsibility  as a response to  the other  in manifest forms, the most radical of which is what is called  death.  Derrida's reflection involves a reading of several texts, philosophical and literary, including those by Plato, the Czech philosopher, Patocka, Heidegger, Levinas, Kierkegaard and Kafka. In the process the relationship between responsibility, the  secret,  the gift and the  gaze of the other is examined. One question to be examined is to what extent the notion of an all-seeing gaze can be deemed to be  absolute .  Such a question may seem abstract when formulated out of context, but its implications are far-reaching and can have profound consequences on political and social life  consequences that the seminar will seek to elucidate.",

The linguistic textual analysis of each reading will focus on: (1) understanding advanced grammatical structures, syntax and style; (2) rapid acquisition of vocabulary and popular idioms (e.g. gender manifestations) through in-class discussions and oral presentations; (3) writing assignments that reflect students' abilities to understand and assimilate the texts. We will work intensively on improving reading-for-comprehension skills, composition, listening and speaking through in-class oral discussions and presentations. Special exercises will be developed to improve understanding and use of essential elements of rhetorical analysis of literary works (        ) and applying them to the texts we read in class.",

    "overview": "This course in critical black studies offers a survey of the history of televisual, cinematic, and social media representations of blackness and the modern civil rights movement from the 1960s to 2016. Black social movements in the 60s strategically mobilized television and news media as a new technology of resistance commemorated and popularly remembered today through images of fire hoses and dogs. Similarly, contemporary black social movement activism mobilizes social media and digital technologies in ways that both challenge and reproduce black political imagination then and now. How do we understand the relationship between blackness, technology and political economy in the post-civil rights era? Does increased visibility or positive representation of African Americans in the media liberate or constrain black political imagination? How is racial progress measured, commodified or thwarted by the production of popular gendered icons of the civil rights movement like Martin Luther King Jr. or Rosa Parks?\n\nStudents will develop visual literacy skills facilitating a deeper understanding of how to critically read, consume and respond to the rapid onslaught of images filtered through online platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr. Examples of content include close readings of cinematic civil rights dramas like Ava Duvernay's Selma (2014) and Rob Reiner's The Ghosts Of Mississippi (1996), photojournalist imagery captured in Birmingham (1963) and Selma (1965) as well as Baltimore and Ferguson in 2015, and documentaries like Spike Lee's 4 Little Girls (1997) and Booker's Place (2012). We will read contemporary literature and media that invokes the memory of black civil rights from past movements for justice. Carries humanities credit.",

The first part of the course examines the genealogy and influence of the pivotal concepts that he espouses such as homo sacer, bare life, and the state of exception.  These notions have generated both vital interest and vehement controversies that seem likely to endure for quite some time.  Through such questions, we examine the advantages and limits of Agamben's thought for contemporary discussions of biopolitics, political philosophy, the Shoah, and postcolonial studies.  The second part of the course is dedicated to exploring Agamben's encounters with figures such as Levi, Melville, and Kafka.  We ask whether his literary readings paradoxically offer a more productive philosophical horizon than does the rest of his thought. \n\nOver the course of the term, we will cover texts by Agamben, Foucault, Deleuze, Schmitt, Benjamin, Butler, Levi, Kafka, and Melville.",

It will span from the basics of U.S. national security structure and military theory to a healthy dose of current events -- and talk of future events. It will do so primarily by drawing on Washington's wealth of experts to provide the most authoritative information and analysis. \n\nEven though this is a lecture class, not a reporting class, you are required to create one reported blog post based on Washington news and one story based on our Medill Explores briefings. You also will have one quiz. \n\nWar, whether the clashing of armies or the stealth of terrorists, is the most complex and destructive of human activities. Covering it is perhaps the most challenging assignment a journalist can have. \n\nMost of you haven't worked or lived in a conflict area. But in the years ahead, you very well might need the skills to succeed in journalism in a difficult scenario. What may be rooted far away has a broad impact wherever you live. Conflicts overseas can cost money, restrict civil liberties, invade personal privacy and can leaves the nation caring for - or burying - those who fought. In addition, conflict and hostile environments can occur within the U.S. - look at white nationalist mayhem and murder Charlottesville, Virginia, or the Baltimore, Maryland riots. \n\nAs our guest speakers often are newsmakers, analysts or current or former government officials with top security clearances, the class sessions will be on background to facilitate a free exchange of ideas and information. Some may be off the record; we will discuss the ground rules at the start of each class. In each class, however, you are encouraged to take extensive notes, engage the lecturers and ask challenging questions, as any good reporter would. You will be expected to be keeping up with current events.  \n\nWe will leave the classroom on several occasions, including a morning at the Pentagon. And, of course, Medill Explores - Europe is associated with this seminar.",

How has race' mattered in the history of the region?  Has race' always constituted an organizational category throughout Latin America?  And, how have the politics of race and sexuality converged in the making of Latin American Nations?  Exploring these questions and many more, this graduate seminar offers a survey of the principle themes, sources, methods and arguments animating scholarship on race, sexuality, and modernity in Latin America.  For much of the twentieth century, Latin American nations worked to construct the identities of \"racial democracies\"countries where the scourge of racism and prejudice could not take root due to processes of whitening via mestizaje (racial mixing) and Catholic education.  Yet, in recent decades, several of these countries have come to recognize the limitations and perhaps the failure of such \"projects,\" even as a growing number of studies have come to highlight the persistent and insidious patterns of racial discrimination and inequality found throughout the region and its history.  This graduate readings course examines a growing body of work on race, gender and sexuality, nation, transnationalism, and diaspora in an attempt historicize the theme and realities of race' in Latin America.  Beginning with literature addressing the foundations and formation of racial subjects in the early modern period, we will survey seminal works addressing casta, race,' gender, sexuality, and Africanity' throughout the region, paying particular attention to the ways in which African-descended peoples navigated the political, discursive, and socio-cultural contexts of a \"racialized\" Latin America.   Centering upon the arguments, sources, and methods of historical work addressing these themes, we will endeavor to identify and isolate historiographical trends while raising questions regarding the future directions in the study of racial subjects, gender, sexuality and transnational Latin America.",

Is there a difference between racism and racial insensitivity, racial anxiety, racial ignorance, and racial injustice? Is the concept of \"race\" itself morally destructive or socially damaging? Is color-blindness the right response to our racial problems, or is it misguided in specifiable ways? How can we overcome deep patterns of mistrust between racialized groups of citizens in the US? Why do American ghettos persist? Should governments foster integrated neighborhoods? How should our criminal justice system treat the oppressed? At the end of the course we will briefly turn to the ancient notion of cosmopolitanism to ask about how to deal with encounters across deep divides of not just race, but also ethnicity, religion, sexuality, and gender orientation.

In the first section of this course, we explore the significance of the history of the construction of the first formal police departments in the South as slave patrols. We consider how the relationship of this institution to Black people shapes the trajectory of policing over time. The second section of this course considers the various modes Black folks have employed to resist police (and policing) including grass roots organizing, music, art, film and education. In this section we examine shifts in both the depictions of police violence and also the kinds of calls for resistance to it. In the final section of the course, we will struggle with what it means to chart a path forward. We consider whether the fundamental relationship between the formal legal-political structure of policing in the U.S. and the Black body is ameliorable; if so, what must be done and by whom? If not, what does that mean for future shifts in strategies of refusal and resistance?",

Through a team-based approach to learning, we will explore how, why, and when the international community is able to overcome collective action problems and effectively address global environmental challenges. The course is divided into three parts. In the first part of the course, we will focus on the problems, institutions, and politics in global environmental governance. The second part of the course focuses on key concepts or themes in global environmental politics that shape our understanding of international cooperation in solving environmental problems, such as science, justice, markets, and security. In the third part of the course, students will participate in an extended negotiation simulation to examine the diverse actors and modes of engagement that define the politics around a particular issue.",

We open with a question that animates the entire course: what is \"the body,\" and how do we know? In the first two weeks, we grapple with the dramatically different ways ancient Chinese and Greek medical traditions (respectively) viewed, touched, and diagnosed the body, seeking to understand how the body has been differently \"constructed\" as an object of knowledge in different parts of the world. Then we broaden our purview to examine how, over the course of Chinese history, the body was closely bound up with ethics; the aspiration to immortality; governance and cosmology; and human interactions with gods and demons (while also looping back to medicine several times). We conclude with two case studies of religion and the body in contemporary China, one situated on the southwestern periphery of the PRC, the other in the capital city of Beijing. Throughout the quarter our attention will move between Buddhist, Daoist, and Confucian traditions, but we will rarely be bounded by these categories. Instead, thematic focus on the body provides a lens through which to see how religion in China routinely breaches such neatly-demarcated categories. By the course's end, students will gain important resources for understanding historical and contemporary Chinese culture, and new perspectives on what it means to be religious and embodied.",

But in hindsight, we can see clearly that such questions have long preoccupied poets, scientists, and philosophers of the past. Behind literature's greener shades, the overlooked figure of inanimate stone looms surprisingly large. In the Romantic era, around the same time that key texts by architects of the modern study of geology James Hutton and Charles Lyell were being published (1780s-1830s), the Revolutionary Age at the close of the 18thcentury put the cosmic notion of \"revolution\" to new use  and great poets were busy giving new resonance to the strange processes of slow inhuman transformation, like petrification, erosion, fossilization, and sedimentation. This course examines the fertile ground where philosophy, science, and poetry met, at the turn of the 18th century and onward; towards the end of the class, we compare the Romantic era's use of geological forms with 20th- and 21st-century poets who have adapted and updated this poetic tradition.",

The role of translation (inter-lingual and cultural) in the depiction of race will be central to our discussions. We will read texts originally written in Arabic, English, French, and Portuguese and indigenous African languages to examine how writers come to terms with the idea of race. Who is an African and who is not? Is race biological or socially constructed? How are non-black races (e.g. Arabs, white, Indians etc.) represented in African writing? How is the \"black\" in Africa different or similar to \"black\" in other parts of the world? How do \"black aesthetics\" and \"black arts\" in Africa differ from similar concepts in black-diaspora cultures? How does racism intersect with other forms of oppression in African societies? How are internal racisms represented in African contexts? How are representations of race in canonical writing (e.g., Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice) treated in African translations and allusions to those texts? Performing both distant and close readings of African writers, we will read primary texts in terms of the techniques individual artists use to treat race matters.  Theory texts will include excerpts from well-known works on the black race by Hegel, Descartes, Kant, Fanon, Memmi as well as newer African and African-diaspora engagements with these texts by such scholars as Charles Mills, Emmanuel Eze, Achille Mbembe, Toni Morrison, Kwame Anthony Appiah, and Stuart Hall.",

    "overview": "Reading Elena Ferrante: The Reinvention of Friendship and Love\n(Taught in English)\n\nIn 2016, Time magazine included the Italian novelist who works under the pseudonym \"Elena Ferrante\" on its list of the year's hundred most influential people.  We will explore some of the most celebrated novels of this mysterious writer, who is beloved not only in Italy but also in the US and around the world.  Critics in The New York Times, The New Yorker, The London Review of Books, and numerous other publications have given ecstatic reviews to her writings, typically describing their effect as \"mesmerizing,\" \"stunning,\" and \"brutally honest.\"  Indeed, Ferrante's fearless, clich-annihilating explorations of friendship, loneliness, troubling loves, sexuality, violence, and maternity suggest a creative and disruptive refashioning of traditional feminist concerns on an epic scale.  We begin our consideration of her work with The Days of Abandonment, which revises the trope of the abandoned woman in new and startling ways.  We will also discuss the cinematic adaptation. We will then read The Lost Daughter, the novelist's sophisticated and uncanny investigation of the agonized ambivalence of love and motherhood. Finally, the course concludes with My Brilliant Friend, the first volume of her bestselling series of Neapolitan novels.  In particular, we will focus on how this text redefines the contested territory of women's friendship. Throughout, we will address Ferrante's decision to keep her true identity secret, thus setting in motion the media's frenzy to unmask her.",

    "overview": "How do contemporary poets write about ideas of community formation, and how is their work sustained, promoted, and nourished by the communities to which they belong? What kinds of social relationships and activist \"social engagements\" does poetry hope to perform or to bring into being?  These are questions we will ask through our studies of a wide variety of U.S., Caribbean, and Latin American poets, from 1989 to the present. We will learn to describe the forms and rhythms of particular works by major and emerging poets, such as Rosa Alcal, Daniel Borzutzky, Fred Moten, Allison Hedge Coke, and Claudia Rankine. We will also emphasize the study of organizations and journals in creating poetic community. This course is organized in conjunction with two major events at Northwestern: the digital reissue of the poetry magazines Mandorla: New Writing from the Americas (1991-2013), and XCP: Cross Cultural Poetics (1997-2015), and two 1-day conferences devoted to their legacies. The class will therefore include the opportunity to attend readings and conference workshops, to meet with a wide variety of contemporary poets, translators, and editors associated with the magazines, including Roberto Tejada, Kristin Dykstra, and Mark Nowak, and to work on digital exhibitions appraising their work and its legacies. Students can expect a mixture of creative and critical assignments, emphasizing both close reading skills and research into the literature and politics of the very recent past and present.\n \nReadings may include the anthology American Poets in the 21st Century: Poetics of Social Engagement (2018), eds. Michael Dowdy and Claudia Rankine, back issues of Mandorla and XCP, and a course reader with criticism by douard Glissant, Nathaniel Mackey, Maria Damon, Jahan Ramazani, Harryette Mullen, and others.",

This course is intended as both a thematic survey of Brazilian lettered culture and an investigation of the development of modern ethnography (largely in France). Firstly, we will discuss the role of European accounts of encounters with the Brazilian landscape and indigenous peoples in the development of modern ethnography; then we will analyze how the Brazilian lettered elite responded to the image of Brazil that was constructed by Europeans as an exotic space, and how they incorporated it into their projects of nation building (from 19th-century Romanticism, to Modernist avant-gardes and beyond). Finally, we will discuss how indigenous cultures remain a heterogeneous space in the national and global imagination, and the political consequences of this contradiction in contemporary societies. Readings will include travel narratives, novels, poems, essays, ethnographic accounts and films. Essays by Montaigne, Lvi-Strauss, Jacques Derrida, Frank Lestringant, Michel de Certeau, Silviano Santiago, James Clifford, Krupat, Walter Mignolo, V.

The course will introduce students to a range of literatures blended with popular culture, multimodal art, and testimonies as a way of deconstructing the institutional logics that reify the \"taken for granted\" nature of the carceral state that has legitimatized the existence and persistence of the American prison and immigration system. This course examines American legal frameworks and traditional conceptualizations of crime and punishment that have confined the very limits of what it means to be free for Latinx people and the ways Latinx communities are represented in American discourse. Together we will explore a series of visceral juxtapositions: freedom and slavery; citizen and illegal; good immigrant and bad immigrant; rehabilitation and punishment; inclusion and exclusion- the lexicon and institutional logics that fuel the carceral state as we know it. Throughout this course we will discuss the construction of these binary definitions and how they have been used and repurposed to inflict state violence on Latinx communities now more than ever. The course will also present people's racialized and minoritized lived experience(s) with the carceral system and its intersections with other systems of state control including immigration policies, the American education system, and the welfare state.",

This course will grapple with the both the origins of this negative bequest as well as some of the anomalies of the medieval tradition. For example, despite the insistence that heterosexuality was ordained by God, the disparagement of physicality and women led to the institutionalization of clerical celibacy in the West. This, in turn, fostered a gay subculture. Likewise, despite the theoretical insistence on a separation between the sexes that was even present in the afterlife, these same theorists not only praised \"virile women,\" but occasionally celebrated cross-dressing in female saints!

    "overview": "The Modern Japanese City \n\nThe Japanese city is the main site of Japanese modernity.  As in many other places with leaders determined to modernize quickly, the prewar Japanese government systematically stripped the countryside of resources in order to build and display the central institutions of a modern nation, most of which were in the cities.  One implication of that longstanding policy was that most ambitious young people left their rural birthplaces for the city, which transformed them in ways that rendered them unfit for rural life.  And, because the countryside was seen by nearly all Japanese before 1945 as the repository of national tradition, leaving the farm meant leaving all things Japanese as well as one's family.  Tokyo was thus simultaneously the epitome of Japan's modern success in economic and political terms and the perceived site of its cultural and social disintegration.  Meanwhile, there were two entirely different models of urban life from the Japanese past: the upper-class model of the samurai and the far less buttoned-down traditions of merchants, artisans, and laborers.  Drawing on these traditions as well as foreign sources, modern urbanites themselves had their own ideas about how to survive in and enjoy the city, ideas that often were at odds with those of national leaders.  \n\nJapanese cities were virtually all leveled in 1945.  After World War II, the newly reconstructed cities became the central arenas for Japanese efforts to create democracy, often with housewives and neighbors' groups at the center of political life.  Those citizens built on the concept of the urbane to institutionalize new kinds of political and social relationships in Japan.  The urban quality of life became a key political issue in the 1960s and 1970s.  Once again, gender and class were important flashpoints for defining an indigenous modernity but so was ethnicity, for example regarding the integration of resident Koreans who had remained in Japan, despite the difficulty of gaining Japanese citizenship.",

In the twentieth century, military strategy and technology blurred the boundaries between war zones and home fronts.  Not only did civilian populations become military targets, but the strains of war also exposed them to food shortages, fuel rationing, forced evacuations, and violent death.  At the same time, disillusioned soldiers and veterans saw their war experiences through the threat of gender inversions.  During the war, women had been mobilized to do men's work.  In the 1920s and 30s, the \"new woman\" of the century - building on the beginnings of legal equality and the vote - enjoyed greater economic, political, intellectual, and sexual freedoms than their nineteenth century grandmothers and great-grandmothers.  If conventional warfare was defined by (and reinforced) traditional notions of masculinity and femininity, did the disruption of those norms mean emancipation for women?  Did the war open up utopian hopes for all forms of alternate gender and sexual alignments, along with new political and economic ideologies?  Ultimately, was a traditional gendered social order restored after the half century of total war and revolutions?  Despite the much touted return to happy domesticity, could the genie of sexual malcontent be ever fully re-contained?\n\nHistory Areas of Concentration: Americas, European",

Medieval culture was fascinated by love and the poets of twelfth-century France invented a model of passionate desire for the other that has had a profound influence up to the present day. From the troubadours' praise of a distant, unattainable stranger, to the forbidden longing of Tristan and Iseut, and the adulterous romance of Lancelot and Guinevere, medieval poets represented love as an all-consuming force, forbidden, but beyond the control of individual will, which produces both intense suffering and transcendent joy at the same time. In this class, we will examine the nature and function of love in medieval narrative poetry, asking how the representation of erotic desire is used to define or disrupt traditional ideas about individual subjectivity, gender dynamics, and the social order.

While drawing from the fields of cinema and media studies, visual studies, and feminist/queer theory, we will focus on the ways in which film and television have simultaneously reflected and shaped our everyday experience and our understanding of gender/sexuality. We will pay particular attention to questions of power, technology, and performance. Among the films we will analyze are Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita (1960) Pietro Germi's Divorce Italian Style (1961), Matteo Garrone's Reality (2012), and Paolo Sorrentino's The Great Beauty (2013).",

We will study both rural village and urban popular contexts. It is my hope that the students will appreciate the richness and diversity of musical expression in Africa and better understand how music informs and reflects lived reality for its practitioners, merchants, and consumers.

    "overview": "Few literatures can have been more isolated and isolating than Modern Hebrew Literature in its formative years in Europe in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Young Jewish men are afforded a glimpse of the intellectual vistas lying beyond the stifling confines of the traditional Jewish shtetl.  Reviled in these traditional communities as \"heretics\" they sought refuge from ostracism, persecution, in the tenements and boarding-houses of the metropolises of Europe. Umbilically attached to an unspoken language these outsiders wrote in full awareness that their potential audience consisted largely of each other. This \"imagined community\" was an exclusively male domain; the handful of female Hebrew writers in the Europe constituted an absolute anomaly. \nIt was in the erotic realm that this isolation reached its fullest literary summation, especially in the figure of the \"Talush\" (\"the uprooted man\") which placed center stage effeminate, masochistic Jewish men often subordinated by ruthless gentile women. This literature breathed of sexual anxiety.\nThe course aims to explore the poetic, the ideological and the gender implications of the interwoven themes of eros and isolation in Hebrew Literature from the turn of the 19th century to the present day.  In doing so, we shall study the migration of these themes along with Hebrew Literature itself from Europe to Palestine and ultimately the State of Israel. Has the rebuilding of the national \"Home\" brought the uprooted man his long lost masculinity? And how did the female writer incorporate/become incorporated by the \"Talush\" narrative? How do we account for the longevity of this sad and pathetic figure? This course provides an excellent introduction to Modern Hebrew Literature per se: we shall read classic texts by M.Y. Berdichevsky, Y.H. Brenner, S.Y. Agnon, alongside excerpts from contemporary bestselling Israeli novels by Amos Oz, Ya'akov Shabtai and others.",

Operas to be studied may include works by Debussy, Puccini, Strauss, Janek, Weill, Berg, Gershwin, Britten, Stravinsky, Messiaen, Adams, and others. Beyond repertoire, we will consider shifts in how opera has been staged, sung, marketed, and mediated. Students will be expected to attend a \"Live in HD\" transmission from the Metropolitan Opera and/or other local performances of relevant repertoire.",

    "overview": "Italian cinema has changed the way in which we conceive of the moving image and its relationship to reality, exercising enormous influence throughout the world. Films like Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita (1960) and actors like Marcello Mastroianni have not only defined a crucial moment in the history of cinema but have also entered our larger cultural imaginary. In this new course format, we will begin by screening a number of contemporary films (including the 2014 Academy Award winning The Great Beauty) and then identify their precursors and sources of inspiration by going back to the heyday of Neorealism in the 1940s (Rossellini, De Sica, Visconti) and the remarkable output of the 1960s and 1970s (Fellini, Antonioni, Pasolini, Bertolucci). At the same time, we will work toward acquiring the critical and methodological tools necessary to analyze film as a complex mode of textual production.",

From that vantage, we'll look both backward - to the Futurists and to Luigi Pirandello and Gadda, as they reworked the old dichotomy between mechanism and vitalism -  and forward - to Calvino, Nanni Balestrini, and Primo Levi, in dialogue with information science and with the notational apparatus of chemistry -We'll conclude reading Laura Pugno's contemporary dystopian fiction questioning the bio-techno-politics of meat production.",

What does it really mean to be a woman or a man -- and are these categories we'r e born into or categories that we become or inhabit through living in a particular way under specific conditions? Human history all the way up to the present seems to be rife with asymmetrical relations of power that relegate those marked out as women to a subordinate position -- what explains this? What would it mean to over turn this state of affairs -- and which strategies are most likely to accomplish this task? And to what extent is it possible to grapple with all of the above questions -- questions of gender, sex and sexuality -- without also, at the very same time, thinking about how they relate to questions of class and race? Readings will include selections from Simone de Beauvoir, Iris Marion Young, Sandra Bartky, bell hooks, Patricia Hill Collins, Judith Butler, Talia Bettcher, and others.",

The practitioners of distinct folkloric musical traditions, the Roma have been evoked in the Western classical tradition since at least the eighteenth century through a system of gestural stereotypes, and such \"gypsy\" representation continues today in the marketing practices of the world music industry. How has the music of this internal ethnic other been appropriated, mimicked, and altered over time? What is the relationship between the folkloric musics of the Roma and their evocation in other repertoires? This class will attempt to answer such questions by focusing on a variety of repertoires performed or inspired by the Roma people, especially Roma music from Hungary and Spain, but also from the Balkans and its roots in India and relationships with klezmer; Andalusian flamenco; 19th-century opera (Bizet's Carmen, Verdi's La traviata); instrumental works by Haydn, Liszt, Brahms, and J. Strauss; Django Reinhardt; recent \"world\" music phenomena such as the Gipsy Kings; and mainstream pop music such as Shakira. The relationship of Roma identity to the writings of Liszt and Bartk will also be considered. Using perspectives of historical musicology, ethnomusicology, and popular music studies, students will explore the dialogic relationship between the Roma and European musics over the past 200 years.",

Prerequisites are completion of a core sequence of courses on Western music history or previous course work in film, theater, or comparative literary studies. Our focus will be a group of operas from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries which were based on pre-existing literary or theatrical works, and which, in turn, inspired cinematic or televised works in the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries. In each case, we will study the literary or theatrical inspiration in its own right (those who can are encouraged to read these classic works in their original languages), become familiar with the opera, and proceed to some famous films and other video adaptations of each opera. We will end the course with a popular film that is directly based on neither a literary original nor an opera, but relies strongly on conventions from both and features a performance of one of our featured operas.",

How has sexuality shaped political and economic processes? In what ways does sexuality intersect with gender, class, race/ethnicity, geographic location, and nationality?

    "overview": "This course has the following main aims. It  introduces key ideas from some of the leading political philosophical traditions such as: social contract tradition, liberalism, republicanism, socialism/Marxism and critical theory. It considers the role of gender and sexuality in these traditions. A historical focus is given to major texts by past women philosophers and political theorists from the 18th to the 20th C, whose reflections on sex, gender and women's rights are also considered classics of political philosophy: this section includes writings by  Mary Wollstonecraft, John Stuart Mill, Harriet Taylor,  Simone de Beauvoir, and Carole Pateman.  A fourth focal point of the course asks how equal rights claims were historically formulated by \"those who had no rights\". Here students draw on their own critical resources to assess the rhetorical and philosophical strategies of some of the most famous rights claims.  Critical focus is given, for example, to the tradition of using analogy to justify rights claims. Thus students will have the opportunity to critical evaluate rights claims based on analogies to animals, slavery, children, and to consider possible alternatives. Texts by white feminists who compared their condition to slavery are discussed in tandem with texts by philosophers of color who have challenged such analogies.  A further  section of the course which  gives a focus to paradoxes and inconsistencies which have arisen in the history of  rights claims discourse  allows student to develop their skills in textual interpretation. A comparative approach is also taken to different rights claims.   The class asks: What are the most imperative rights claims formulated by those who had no rights? What should those who seek equal rights actually claim? How has the  perception of these imperatives transformed over time? How do the intersecting perspectives of gender, sexuality, race, and class change these imperatives?    Finally, the course also gives attention to the role of gender and sexuality in contemporary political theory, focussing on debates about justice and the family, pornography, prostitution, surrogacy contracts,  the 'politics of the veil' in the public sphere, multiculturalism, and challenges from contemporary theorists whose work is based in the resources of intersectionality theory, critical race theory, and queer theory. A final section on contemporary debates and figures in feminist political philosophy, includes excepts by contemporary philosophers and political thinkers such as Susan Moller Okin, Carole Pateman, Joan Scott and Judith Butler.",

In this course we get to know theology's unique way of making sense of human existence on the planet. Or more precisely, we learn how to ask theological questions that have preoccupied humans for centuries: What does it mean to be human? Why does evil exist? What does God do with the world? We will address these questions by considering theologians from past, such as Martin Luther, and present, namely Black theologian James Cone and feminist theologian Elizabeth Johnson.",

On Mondays and Wednesdays, the course meets with RTVF 312-1 for lectures and screenings. For our Thursday meetings (seminar discussion for RTVF 412-0 only), we will discuss readings, films, and approaches to the history and historiography of cinema. Topics covered include the cinema of attractions; the development of narrative filmmaking in the United States and Europe; the studio systems of Hollywood and Japan; exhibition practices; the concept of national cinemas as exemplified by the cinemas of France, Germany, and the Soviet Union; the avant-garde and cinema's relation to art movements; the coming of synchronized sound; documentary cinema; and diverse conceptualizations of cinema's political possibilities and dangers.

The first part of the course will begin with a discussion about what inequality is and how to measure it. We will discuss how inequality in earnings, wealth, and wellbeing have changed in the U.S. over time, and will talk about various economic theories to explain these changes. The second part of the course will explore policies designed to address the causes and consequences of inequality. We will also learn about fundamental economic concepts - including opportunity cost, comparative advantage, supply and demand, human capital, and individual responses to incentives - as a way to critically examine the effectiveness of these policies. The final part of the course will focus specifically on inequality along race and gender lines, with some attention to whether these differences are the result of discrimination.

We will consider questions such as: does fascism represent a coherent set of ideas and practices? Who joined fascist movements and why? Is fascism a form of populism? What is fascism's relationship to imperialism? Why were fascists obsessed with national, sexual, and racial identities? Is \"fascism\" still a useful concept for helping us to understand developments since 1945, or was it a purely interwar phenomenon?",

Law shapes our daily lives in countless ways.  This course examines the connections and relationships of law and society using an interdisciplinary social science approach. As one of the founders of the Law and Society movement observed, \"Law is too important to leave to lawyers.\" Accordingly, this course will borrow from several theoretical, disciplinary, and interdisciplinary perspectives (including sociology, history, anthropology, political science, and psychology) in order to explore the sociology of law and law's role.  This course introduces the relationship between social, cultural, political, and economic forces on the one hand, and legal rules, practices, and outcomes, on the other.  We focus on several important questions about law including:  How do culture, structure, and conflict explain the relationship between law and society? Why do people obey the law? Why do people go to court? How does the legal system work? What is the role of lawyers, judges, and juries? How does law on the books differ from law in action? How do social problems become legal ones? How can law create or constrain social change?",

Students will learn about major challenges for achieving more sustainable societies through the lenses of different overarching analysis principles, including life-cycle analysis, technology stock modeling, cost analysis, and considerations of time, location, and development when assessing opportunities for societal change. These principles will be applied in homework assignments and the course project to develop basic quantitative insights into societal challenges related to energy and resource use, consumption and development, and environmental damages. These analytical perspectives will be employed by students to develop an understanding of potential solution pathways, including technology deployment, behavioral and societal changes, and policies, standards, and regulations as well as the human, institutional, and political barriers to these pathways.",

    "overview": "In the late nineteenth century, anarchist and Marxist thought filtered into the Andes through two principal avenues: radical political activists and elite intellectual circles. While the initial points of entry of these socio-critical discourses were the region's ports and cities, they quickly found their way to the most recondite parts of the region. This course proposes to investigate the shape that anarchist and Marxist thought took upon its contact with Andean societies through to its later development among various actors and at diverse sites, from 1890-1950. Already in the work of the Peruvian Manual Gonzlez Prada in the 1890's, an anarchist critique of property is retooled in order to address local semi-feudal land-owning regimes. Over the course of the first decades of the 20th century, a slew of intellectual-activists take up powerfully influential Marxism in order to tailor it to local contexts and histories. Some examples include the works of Miguelina Acosta Crdenas, Jos Carlos Maritegui, Csar Vallejo, Ral Haya de la Torre, and Manuel Seoane, in Peru; Jorge Icaza, Enrique Gil Gilbert, Demetrio Aguilera Malta, Manuel Agustn Aguirre, and Joaqun Gallegos Lara in Ecuador; and Tristn Marof, Arturo Urquidi Morales, Gamaliel Churata, and Jos Antonio Arze in Bolivia.  At the same time, both in contact with intellectuals and independently, urban and indigenous activists such as Carlos Condorena, Ezequiel Urviola, Domitilia Pareja, and Luis Cusicanqui developed their own hybridizations of critical Marxist and anarchist discourses that sought to suture urban revolutionary movements with longstanding indigenous rejections of a colonial status quo.\nIn order to understand both the processes of transmission of these discourses and the particular transformations they underwent in the Andes, the seminar highlights the exceptional diversity of forms that these interventions took, from essay and chronicle to novel and poetry, from broadsheets and working-class press to public protest and violent rebellions, across the linguistic registers of Spanish to the region's indigenous languages. How did basic notions of class, commodity, and revolution, shift when faced with realities of indigenous social formations and history?  What transformations were introduced into received Marxism and anarchism when they were transmitted into oral, regional Spanish as well as Aymara and Quechua?  How did Marxists and anarchists conceptualize semi-feudal societies and their economies?  How did they engage indigenous social formations and cultures? What modifications did working-class and indigenous activists introduce into the new critical discourses they encountered?  Finally, the seminar will consider the reflection on European critical-theoretical traditions that their reception and immediate modification in Latin America constitutes.",

We will examine a diverse array of texts - poetry, novels, short stories, films and critical essays - produced in both Spanish and English both in the Caribbean and in the United States by writers of Puerto Rican, Dominican and Cuban origin.  As we read, we will use exile and diaspora as lenses through which to interrogate other aspects of Latinx-Caribbean literature.  How are these experiences portrayed, and what role have they played in the construction of identities, both personal and collective?  How have these situations shaped the development of Caribbean communities (both physical and literary) within the continental U.S.?  Should exile and diaspora be seen as patterns connected to globalization, thus serving to complicate our idea of what is Caribbean, or can they in fact be seen as fundamental to the construction of Caribbean-ness?  We will look at how these movements affect the treatment of race and gender in these works, and we will analyze the role of nostalgia and humor in the navigation of different cultural and geographic spaces. \n\nReadings will be drawn from the work of the following authors:  douard Glissant, Antonio Bentez Rojo, Stuart Hall, Christina Sharpe, Rubn Ros vila, Pedro Pietri, Reinaldo Arenas, Manuel Ramos Otero, Soleida Ros, Aurora Arias, Josefina Bez, Pedro Cabiya, Legna Rodrguez Iglesias, Rita Indiana Hernndez, Frank Bez, and Urayon Noel, among others.

This course is intended as both a thematic survey of Brazilian lettered culture and an investigation of the development of modern ethnography (largely in France). Firstly, we will discuss the role of European accounts of encounters with the Brazilian landscape and indigenous peoples in the development of modern ethnography; then we will analyze how the Brazilian lettered elite responded to the image of Brazil that was constructed by Europeans as an exotic space, and how they incorporated it into their projects of nation building (from 19th-century Romanticism, to Modernist avant-gardes and beyond). Finally, we will discuss how indigenous cultures remain a heterogeneous space in the national and global imagination, and the political consequences of this contradiction in contemporary societies. Readings will include travel narratives, novels, poems, essays, ethnographic accounts and films. Essays by Montaigne, Lvi-Strauss, Jacques Derrida, Frank Lestringant, Michel de Certeau, Silviano Santiago, James Clifford, Krupat, Walter Mignolo, V.

Participants will debate the claims driving our readings; assess their evidence, methods, and bibliographies; contextualize the scholarly, historical, cultural, and political trends that frame those arguments and how they are expressed; and articulate varying levels of agreement, disagreement, or ambivalence in relation to these texts, making sure we grasp the original writers' goals clearly enough to furnish expansions or corrections of our own.  \n\nThis year's Capstone will revolve around Margaret Atwood's novel The Handmaid's Tale (1985).  We will engage this text because it synthesizes so many ideas and arguments in gender and sexuality studies and in adjacent fields (including political science, critical race theory, environmental humanities, legal studies, and feminist art-making) and because its selection as this year's One Book, One Northwestern text creates a unique opportunity for collaborative learning across seniors and first-years.  Assignments and discussionswide-ranging though they arewill pertain directly or indirectly to key themes in Atwood's novel or to academic and public conversations that have unfolded around it and its multimedia adaptations.  Student responses will manifest in short writing exercises, some longer papers, and weekly discussions that will be detailed, collegial, and fortified by existing knowledge that participants carry with them from prior and current coursework.  The class will culminate in a showcase of original student research and writing about The Handmaid's Tale and all the gendered and sexual discourses in which the novel participates.  First-year students will attend this conference as informed audiences for our highly-trained seniors, who will also pick up marketable skills of research preparation, polished presentation, and writing across multiple genres, including for the public.",

Likewise, one might argue that it is Julio Cortzar's short fiction--even more than his \"revolutionary\" novels--that will stand the test of time. Indeed, these and other well-known writers associated with the \"gnero fantstico\" (e.g., Horacio Quiroga, Luisa Valenzuela, Rosario Ferr) are among the \"masters\" of the Latin American short story who have taught us new ways to read and think about narrative more generally. Within the context of the Latin American tradition, we will focus on the short story as it has been written and theorized by Latin American writers, considering as well proposals from beyond the region and reading models offered by literary critics and theorists.

How have virtual technologies challenged experiences of language, gender, community and identity?

    "overview": "As debates continue over the future course of queer and feminist studies, scholars have continually turned back to the material records of past queer and feminist lives found within archives. Venturing into the data and documents of the past raises several historical and political considerations, as these lives and communities can remain obscured, unruly, or simply forgotten within traditional narratives and methods. Making matters more complicated, acts of silencing can take place not only when the lives of women, queer subjects, and others are omitted altogether from historical records but when they are poorly transcribed, confusingly categorized, or distorted by projecting present terms and values onto past lives. This course considers the acts necessary to build, use, and sustain queer and feminist archives by adopting two tasks. First, the course introduces students to theoretical writings on the ways archives document and preserve information related to gender and sexuality, with emphasis on materials related to musical and performing arts. Second, course discussions, readings, and assignments provide students firsthand experience of conducting archival research by working with Northwestern's Special Collections and University archives, and with other local archives such as the Leather Archives and Museum and Gerber Hart Library.",

In each case, we will consider how activists frame the problem, the tactics they use to mobilize a diverse group of social actors around the problem, and their success in creating a social movement that challenges contemporary medical models and the ideological assumptions that inform them.

Students will learn how to conduct in-depth interviews, on a particular topic, to gather oral narratives and their meanings from specific family, friends, or community members. (2) Myth. Students will read and discuss ancient and contemporary myths to unravel deeper questions about local and global experiences. (3) News Reports. Through guided instruction students will select a current news story, from electronic or newspaper journalism, they feel reveals an urgent issue they are compelled to share. Each of the three units will culminate in a performance: a solo performance of an oral narrative, a group performance of a myth and, finally, a multi-media group performance of a news story. The course is highly interactive and performance based. The unifying thread and overarching question for the course is: How does storytelling performance and creative communication help us better engage and illuminate our world and the world of others, e.g., identity, family, community, nation, social relations, political institutions and economic orders?",

While we will examine how the U.S. Supreme Court has defined these rights and liberties, we will not confine ourselves to reading only Supreme Court opinions. We will also be interested in how other political actors (e.g., Congress, the executive branch, the states, and the mass public) have argued about, imagined, and effectuated limits on government power.\n\n Crucially, this is *not* a constitutional law class or a \"preview\" of what a constitutional law class in a law school might be like. Instead, we will be focused on thinking about civil rights and liberties from a political and developmental perspective. To give just one example, the meaning and scope of First Amendment's \"free speech\" clause has dramatically changed over time, especially within the past 100 years. In order to understand how and why our rights and liberties have been politically constructed and expanded (or truncated) we will situate the debates about our rights and liberties within the political, social, and intellectual environments in which they occur(ed). Thus, the material covered is organized chronologically rather than thematically. \n\n 25 percent of your grade: one-page reading response papers due to your TA the evening before Discussion Sections\n 35 percent of your grade: Mid-term Examination\n 40 percent of your grade: Take-Home Final Exam",

We will pay attention to how seemingly gender-neutral laws may have particularly gendered effects based on social context. We will also examine how various groups have used the law to strengthen and to challenge existing gender norms, identities, and roles.

Tourists marvel at the size of the sites and empathize with the plight of the towns' inhabitants. However, Campania's destroyed cities have much more to offer than the familiar story of the 79 AD earthquake. Rather than presenting a static picture of Campania's towns as \"frozen in time,\" this course takes a diachronic approach to the rich archaeological material. \nCampania was not originally Roman territory and was conquered by force of arms. Pompeii for instance, often presented as an archetypal Roman town, was not Roman at all for most of its existence. Still, at the time of the eruption Campania's cities were thoroughly Romanized; they are now famous for the evidence they provide for Roman daily life. \nThis course will survey key aspects of the evidence, which will include a discussion of current archaeological techniques and fieldwork. The course will also discuss the 18th century uncovering of Campania's cities, which is a story in its own right. Contemporaries were sometimes shocked by what they found. But they also admired the ancient art, and the towns' rediscovery deeply influenced European artistic tastes. The course will include discussions of the impact that the discoveries had on the 18th and 19th century imagination.",

This transition had a major impact on our economy. Although there has been a leveling off of this growth, compositional changes continue. This course will use economic methods to analyze these changes and help explain the associated gender differences in employment and earnings.  Economic models based on rational choice theory will be used to explain how individuals make decisions about the allocation of time between non-market and market activities, and investments in different types of human capital.  The interaction between these decision making processes and cultural imperatives, technology, public policy, among other key factors, will be explored.  Empirical evidence will be used to evaluate the validity of predicted outcomes of these models.",

    "overview": "At the advent of increased globalization some scholars have argued that the movements of capital, commodities and people across nation-states have rendered their borders increasingly more porous. The death of the nation-state and the birth of the multinational corporation heralded this new epoch. Yet, in the epoch of offshored refugee processing centers and border walls, this assumed porosity of borders begs a reexamination of broader geographies of power and tactics of movement. In this course, we examine the historically and geographically specific constellations of borders and ask: How does the border become an architecture of regulation that extends access to mobility to some and denies it to others? What is a border? Is it the physical line drawn between two states? Who gets to draw these lines? Is a state border a given result of a natural and ethnic contract or the terrain of constant contestation or negotiation in global and international affairs? This course examines these questions by proposing to reconceptualize border as equally the product of mobile social actors, contraband commodities and fluctuating values as they are of state policies aimed at managing these movements.",

While we will cultivate a healthy skepticism toward the historical content of pop-cultural representations, our focus is not on myth-busting but rather on understanding the evolution and uses of such figures as they circulate between history, cultural memory, and popular fantasy. What values have modern Japanese thinkers invested in the memory of the samurai, and why does the figure appeal so much to Western fantasies of Japan? How has the image of the samurai transformed to reflect the cultural desires and anxieties projected onto it?",

    "overview": "The MENA Colloquium is designed to encourage dialogue between students across disciplines who share interests in Middle East and North African Studies, to offer a space to develop extended papers and research reports, and to foster discussion between Northwestern MENA students and faculty. Students begin by enrolling in MENA 412-1 followed by MENA 412-2 as zero credit courses. Upon successful completion of MENA 412-1,2 students may enroll in MENA 412-3, completion of which earns one course credit. Students taking the 3 part MENA 412 sequence must present their work at a MENA colloquium at least one time per academic year, pre-circulate their paper to other members of the seminar, make one formal response, participate in online Blackboard discussion, and attend all MENA colloquia plus selected invited speakers. In order to obtain a Certificate in MENA Studies, students must enroll in three quarters of MENA 412 (one course credit) and three quarters of MENA 415 (which meets at the same time as MENA 412, and is otherwise identical, but does not require a public presentation or comment and bears no credit). Attendance at the colloquium is open to the public, though precirculated papers are only accessible to students enrolled in the MENA 412 sequence. Requirements (for MENA 412) : 15-20 page paper on an independent research project, submitted and circulated one week prior to colloquium session. 20-25 minute presentation based on the paper, ideally with visuals and/or handouts. One formal response to another student presentation. Active participation in the colloquium and online discussion. Note: MENA 412-1,2,3 is normally completed in a single academic year, but can also be spread over two academic years, with consent of MENA director. Please note: this is a three quarter long sequence bearing one course credit; it meets several times per quarter, to be determined at the first class session.",

This introductory lecture course is designed to help students understand the relatively recent origins of many of these problems, focusing especially on the last one hundred and fifty years. Students will have an opportunity to learn about the environmental effects of urbanization, industrialization, population growth, market economies, empire-building, intercontinental warfare, energy extraction, and new technologies. They will also explore different environmental philosophies and analytic frameworks that help us make sense of historical change, including political ecology, environmental history, science studies, and world history. Finally, the course will examine a range of transnational organizations, social movements, and state policies that have attempted to address and resolve environmental problems.",

The course progresses via explorations of an array of examples, readings, theoretical and technical tutorials, class guests, production assignments, and critique sessions.\n \nInteractive narrations can transform the \"audience\" to a \"participant\" by giving them agency to explore or generate the content.  This transformation requires an understanding of a set of concepts such as, creating clear navigation, supporting the widest agency of the players, creating multiplay value, making the interaction method clear, engaging, metaphorical and in some cases poetic, whimsical, empathetic. Interactive documentaries can be distributed through web, museums, art galleries, media art festivals, and on the streets in the form of public art. In that sense, this course expands the horizon of a filmmaker who may be focused on traditional festival distribution of documentaries.\n \nIn order to establish a common terminology to criticize and produce interactive narrative works, we will survey a wide spectrum of web documentaries, interactive video walks, documentary games, virtual reality (VR), alternate reality (AR), fragmented reality, 360-degree video, projection art, tangible objects, art installations, data visualization and sonification pieces. We will develop an understanding of the affordances and limitations of these novel environments. \n \nWe will merge virtual and physical worlds and we will design fiction or non-fiction storytelling, game, art, documentary pieces that create or benefit from 360 video, virtual reality, fragmented reality, and projection art.",

The aim of this course is to provide an overview of the materials currently in use in magnetic data storage, together with an overview of the recording and read processes. Further this course will give the student enough background in magnetism and magnetic materials to understand WHY particular materials are favored. The course will also briefly overview other information storage systems such as optical, solid-state and probe storage. The course is not quantum-mechanical in outlook as this is not really necessary to explain the materials choices, and the main theoretical background will be to arrive at an understanding of the four energy terms that control the properties of magnetic materials when they are patterned at the nanoscale. Magnetic device sizes are fast becoming smaller than the limit for semiconductor devices and this places considerable challenges on the materials systems that can be used.",

The course will survey some of the concepts of \"culture\" that have been used to describe and analyze the constitution and consequences of communicative behavior in the past and survey some of the most influential work that has been based upon such conceptualizations. Focusing principally (though not exhaustively) on the Frankfurt School and critical cultural theory traditions, on cultural studies (as articulated initially within British and American contexts), and on anthropological approaches to culture, we will consider how these traditions have engaged political economy, concepts of power and its exercise, and questions of identity, subject, and community formation.",

Why are the two greatest love poetry books of the Italian literary tradition marked by the sudden death of the poets' beloved. Both Beatrice - the Christ-like lady loved and mourned by Dante in his Vita Nova - and Laura - the angelic figure who catches Petrarch's heart in his Canzoniere -  die mid-way the poets' intimate accounts. Yet the writers' love is strengthened and their poetic self bolstered. Why is death necessary to allow the poets to continue their sentimental and spiritual journeys beyond the constraints of body and matter?

We will explore some of the most celebrated novels of this mysterious writer, who is beloved not only in Italy but also in the US and around the world.  Critics in The New York Times, The New Yorker, The London Review of Books, and numerous other publications have given ecstatic reviews to her writings, typically describing their effect as \"mesmerizing,\" \"stunning,\" and \"brutally honest.\"  Indeed, Ferrante's fearless, clich-annihilating explorations of friendship, loneliness, troubling loves, sexuality, violence, and maternity suggest a creative and disruptive refashioning of traditional feminist concerns on an epic scale.  We begin our consideration of her work with The Days of Abandonment, which revises the trope of the abandoned woman in new and startling ways.  We will also discuss the cinematic adaptation. We will then read The Lost Daughter, the novelist's sophisticated and uncanny investigation of the agonized ambivalence of love and motherhood. Finally, the course concludes with My Brilliant Friend, the first volume of her bestselling series of Neapolitan novels.  In particular, we will focus on how this text redefines the contested territory of women's friendship. Throughout, we will address Ferrante's decision to keep her true identity secret, thus setting in motion the media's frenzy to unmask her.",

Homework problems involve using open-source codes compiled on Quest HPC system, as well as minor programming assignments. Homework material is integrated with in-class exercises, where the students can run simulations using an online NanoHub toolset developed for this class. \n\nProject\n\nStudents will have the opportunity to apply the concepts that they have learned in class to a research problem of their own interest. Projects typically include an atomistic simulation aspect and some preliminary theoretical concepts on the expected observations. Topics can include and not be limited to self-assembly, elasticity of biomolecules, carbon nanostructures, reactive modeling of fracture, and system dynamics.

How does culture influence the way that mental illness is expressed and experienced and how does this affect our ability to measure psychological illness cross-culturally? How do cultural factors affect the way that mental illnesses are diagnosed and labeled, and the degree to which they are stigmatized? And how do such factors affect our ability to create effective public health interventions? Finally, how do healing practices and the efficacy of particular treatments vary across cultures? By examining these and related questions, in the context of specific mental illnesses including schizophrenia, depression, and PTSD students are exposed to a unique set of ideas otherwise unrepresented in the current global health curriculum. Mental health is crucially linked to physical health, and represents an enormous global health burden in its own right. It is crucial, therefore, that global health students be introduced to central issues related to epidemiology and intervention in this area.",

Some of these travelers were world historical figures, while others were ordinary, common people nearly forgotten to history.

We will focus on Atlantic travelers who effected and reflected historical change relating to three themes: racism and American slavery, industrial capitalism, and anti/colonialism. These themes are not isolated to the past; they continue to unfold in the present, shaping societies across the globe in the twenty-first century. Students will gain an understanding of how disparate histories in Africa, the Americas, and Europe were (and remain) interconnected on multiple scales, from individual to empire.

What constitutes movement and how is it deliberately and/or inadvertently enacted and represented in performance? How do political and social economies of power dictate the trajectories of bodies in particular environments? What is the relationship between the stage as site of movement-based performance and other everyday spaces? How do quotidian or aesthetic choreographies move and translate across frame, scale, and context (the classroom, the campus, the city)? How is place created through physical intervention and what role do we have as mobile individuals and collectives in shaping structures?

    "overview": "In most markets, firms compete for customers by making profit-maximizing decisions about prices, capacity, location, quality, variety, investment and product innovation. These decisions are especially interesting when there are several firms with interdependent payoffs; e.g., the choice of one firm to cut its price or close a retail store affects not only its profits, but also rival firms' profits. Inspired by both classical and modern readings about strategy, we develop and employ game theory tools to study firm behavior in a variety of scenarios, beginning with static (one period) models, and then turning to dynamic settings, in which firms may pursue profits through mergers, R&D investments, or the timing of a product launch. We also explore pricing schemes as well as tactics managers might use to modify the business environment in ways that enhance their firms' long-run profits. E.g., a firm may try to drive rivals out of the market, keep potential rivals from entering the market, or cooperate with rivals - strategies that may dampen competitive forces and possibly run afoul of antitrust laws.",

And now the rise of right-wing populists in Europe, a newly activist Russia and the presidency of Donald Trump. This course uses an engaging set of examples and materials to chart one of the most intriguing stretches of international engagement in U.S. history. We will work collaboratively to understand why decisions were made, how policies were implemented and sold, and what it all may mean in the end. Assessing sources from presidential speeches and critics' rejoinders to film documentaries and media accounts, we will study goals and motivations, ends and means, in an array of case studies.

This course will survey core Earth system science topics, introduce numerical modeling concepts, and facilitate the construction of dynamical models in a hands-on computational laboratory environment. Core topics reviewed and modeled include Earth's energy balance, carbon cycle, and climate. The lecture portion of the course will highlight/review Earth science concepts, while the modeling component of the course will focus on the design, construction, and use of models to test hypotheses, and increase understanding of the forces and processes that shape the global environment. The modeling software to be used will be appropriate to undergraduates and beginning graduate students who do not have previous experience with solving differential equations or with computer programming, though students with these skill sets will appreciate the manifestation of numerical rules in the software package. Ultimately, this course is designed to empower students with introductory modeling skills that can be used to build a better understanding of how Earth's various components interact and evolve.",

We'll ask how Native writers created and preserved pre-colonial media and how they transformed colonial educational programs like boarding schools to advocate on behalf of their people.  How have Native writers used their literary traditions to criticize colonialism and imagine futures for their people?  How does our view of American literature, broadly speaking, change when we account for the long histories and multiple media of Native literatures?",

Using this lens, it identifies both opportunities for meaningful political action and challenges for successful local governance in large cities. The course capstone is a case study of a particular contemporary political actor and an analysis of that actor's strategy for pursuing a specific goal, with attention to both the hurdles and opportunities that present themselves to local political actors. Over the term, students learn current models of local politics; encounter illustrations of how actors can design institutions that structure outcomes, and how layered institutions intersect with each other; and learn how these ideas have been important in shaping the course of Chicago's political and social realities.

Through exposure to and engagement with interdisciplinary research methods on law and legal processes, the course will provide students with a deeper understanding of law in its historical and social context.  The course will provide students with a set of research tools with which to conduct research on legal institutions.   The course builds on content from Legal Studies 206, a prerequisite for 207. While part of the Legal Studies major sequence, the course will enrich the analytic skills of students from many fields who are interested in law or in interdisciplinary research methods.  Prerequisite: LEGAL_ST/SOCIOL 206. Taught with SOCIOL 227; may not receive credit for both courses.  \n\nIn Spring 2019, the topical focus of the course will be violence by the police and capital punishment in the United States.  These topics will be explored with interdisciplinary readings and relevant legal cases.  Students will be exposed to several research tools and research processes, as they also engage with material on police violence and capital punishment.  In addition to shorter assignments, students will develop their own specific research project and write a research paper relating to capital punishment or police violence.",

We focus on non-electrode methods to study neural circuits and behavior including mutant analysis, neuroanatomical techniques, and behavioral paradigms such as courtship, aggression, circadian and sleep behavior. We will use the fruit fly as a model system because of the amazing genetic tools available to study the fly nervous system and the conservation of basic neurobiological processes between flies and humans. During the first section of the course you will learn a variety of techniques to study the nervous system. You will then design a project using the techniques learned in class, to be completed in the final weeks of the course. This will be summarized in a lab report due during finals week.\n NOTE 1: <strong> This course requires manual dexterity, steady hands, and good vision. You will need to handle flies while keeping them healthy, dissect their brain tissue, and troubleshoot practical problems. If any of these might pose challenges for you, please talk to the instructor before registering.</strong>    \n NOTE 2: You will need to come into the labs outside class time at least a few times a week to collect virgin flies. This is done at the beginning and the end of the day and it is an ongoing task. Later in the course you will likely also need to come to finish experiments. Time outside regularly scheduled class is 2 or more hours per week typically and motivated students are encouraged to spend more time.

Key topics that we will consider include variations in the relationship between warfare and public health across eras and cultures; the health and mental health impacts of forced displacement, military violence, and gender-based violence; and the roles of medical humanitarianism and humanitarian psychiatry in postwar recovery processes. Through close readings of classic and contemporary social theory, ethnographic accounts, and diverse research on war, health, and postwar humanitarian interventions, this course will encourage you to build your own critical perspective on war and public health anchored in history and the complexities of real-world situations.",

In the subsequent three weeks, we will design our productions, write scripts, conduct rehearsals, and record bespoke soundscapes and Foley effects. The final third of the quarter will consist of recording, mixing and peer critique. In the last week of the course, we will have a screening of the Hitchcock film together with a special presentation of our final works that will be open to the public.

    "overview": "On a daily basis we consumeoften without notice or concerna substantial amount of racial knowledge. We routinely ingest, for example, infographics about demographic trends, media coverage on crime and undocumented immigration, and advertisements for group-specific medicines. In complex and contextually specific ways, this diet shapes our personal and collective identities, social interactions and relationships, and political aspirations and anxieties. In this course, we endeavor to study the politics of racial knowledgethat is, the ways in which categories, measurements, and other techniques of knowledge production have helped to constitute \"race\" as a seemingly objective, natural demarcation among human populations as well as legitimate and, in some cases, contest, forms of racial domination and inequality. Drawing on diverse historical, anthropological, sociological, and philosophical texts, this course explores of the emergence, evolution, and effects of scientific forms of racial knowledge. This exploration will begin by discussing the historical relationship between the modern concept of race and European colonialism and slavery. Subsequently, we will track several major developments in the history of racial knowledge, from Enlightenment philosophy to contemporary genomics research. In these travels we will pose and ponder on the following questions: How have scientistsindependently and in conjunction with governments and corporationsconceptualized, measured, and described race? What instruments have been used to demonstrate the so-called objectivity of race and racial hierarchy? How has the human body been made both an object and product of racial knowledge? How have political and intellectual movements and the media advanced or contested the production of essentialist, race-based explanations of human difference? Finally, what role can (and should) racial knowledge play in addressing racial inequality and exclusion in the present?",

Our hope is to facilitate the creation, innovation, and organization of new ideas and companies in the field of creative arts. The goal of this course is to help students understand that success in the arts is a function of passion, work ethic, talent, and entrepreneurial drive. Those applying for this class should share a desire to learn about and/or desire to start a company in the creative arts. \n\nIn the past twenty years, digital disruption has upended many industries including the music, film, and television, and has erased most of the barriers to entry in those industries. Furthermore, the transparency of the Internet has shifted the power from large corporations to anyone who has a great idea, talent, and Internet connectivity. Digital technology allows artists to have greater control over their careers and enables entrepreneurs to create new companies that disrupt the traditional way of doing things.  \n\nNUvention: Arts studies how different industries within the arts currently work and examines opportunities for disruption through a variety of teaching approaches including:\n\nCase Study\nLecture\nGuest Speakers\nTeam Project(s) \nThe class chair and lead faculty member is Gregg Latterman. Latterman is an NU alum who founded Aware Records in 1993. Latterman's initial focus was to find the best unsigned musical acts in the country and increase their national exposure through compilation. Through Aware's relationship with Columbia Records, they have released full-length albums by artists such as Mat Kearney, Train, Five for Fighting, and John Mayer.  He is also currently producing a documentary about last year's soccer exhibition at Soldier Field, in which former NU soccer players played with Lionel Messi and friends. NUvention: Arts will also have an advisory board of alumni and friends of Northwestern who have achieved success in one or many areas of the arts to assist in curriculum development and student coaching.\n\nNUvention: Arts will be offered by a unique partnership of all Northwestern schools facilitated by the Farley Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. It joins seven other classes in the NUvention program including Analytics, Energy, Medical, Nanotechnology, Impact, Web + Media, and Journalism and Technology.",

How do issues of sustainability affect our current use of resources, both renewable (food, forest, wild game, water) and non-renewable (land, fossil fuels)?

Marketing a creative enterprise requires as much time, attention and toil as the core creative product, itself. It requires a blend of art and science: an appreciation for the fundamentals of consumer-centered marketing with an understanding of the special requirements of the creative enterprise itself. MSLCE 472 will introduce students to the most contemporary thinking related to consumer-centered marketing, known as IMC.  The course is intentionally designed to blend theory with application both inside and outside of the classroom.",

Among the topics explored are the history of the idea of the Middle East and the multiple meanings of modernity in that context; the complex relations between the Middle East and the West, the historical formation of Middle East nation-states, polities, ideologies, identities, and economies; and the dynamic struggles unfolding in the region since the 2011 Arab uprisings. The course will consider the making of these structures, events, and relationships from a range of perspectives, including imaginative ones. Course material will encompass literary, cinematic, historical, and social science materials, as well as both primary documents and secondary scholarly sources.",

How does renewed attention to this early period help us bring into focus the contributions of radical Black abolitionists? How do the shifting concerns of these various communities and coalitions compete or collaborate? To answer these questions, we will read from a broad selection of early antislavery writing, while also looking toward Octavia Butler's genre defying novel, Kindred (1979), as a lifeline to the present. We will explore abolition as a religiously inflected literary genre and will investigate how antislavery work inspired new forms of communication and literary style. Together we will read novels, poems, pamphlets, sermons, and personal narratives, paying attention to these emergent abolitionist forms.",

We end with a study of how institutions persist - possibly beyond their useful lifespan - such as the persistence of the intentionally inefficient QWERTY' keyboard, and a conversation about why it's difficult to enact policy change. \nThe course has two overarching goals.

Although the focus will be on visual reporting students will be asked to write components necessary for full reporting, such as captions, sidebar articles and/or introductions. Students will produce one major reporting project and two smaller ones by the end of the quarter.\n \nStudents will be asked to read articles and books and watch videos and documentaries that will help them think critically about the seismic changes happening in Cuba today and the issues that raises for its people.\n \nTravel component\nStudents in this program will talk with people about their daily lives and hear from experts, building on the context and sources that we will develop prior to the trip. This trip will include some or all of the following; walking tours, experts talks on a variety of topics, cultural events, meeting with Cuban university students and visiting historical touchpoints.

Considering the ancient roots of satire, its connections with its most famous progenitors, Horace and Juvenal, and the often openly aggressive strategies used by the earliest male satirists and their descendants, it is perhaps to be expected that an intelligent, market-savvy female writer would hesitate to avow her satirical roots. However, there were more women writing satire over the years than most modern anthologies (and even critical works) reflect.\n\nIn addition to examining and evaluating some of the most (in)famous satires written targeting women, we will read satires authored by women, from the 18th century to the modern erafrom Jane Austen to Margaret Atwood to Tina Fey.

As improper use or inadequate protection of the data can result in civil or even criminal penalties to both companies and executives, it is imperative that marketing professionals understand the technology that underlies the digital data landscape, and further understand the legal and regulatory environment within which they are operating when using the data for marketing and other business purposes. \n\n \n\nThe first half of the course will focus on the data ecosystem and privacy. Here, the class will explore the technology underlying data tracking, collection, aggregation and use.  Further, the course will examine data brokers/aggregators and their role in the communications development chain. Finally, the course will cover the legal and regulatory perspective toward the industry's privacy-related behavior and practices in the development of marketing communications. \n\n \n\nThe second half of the course will focus on data security.

As such, the class will address the rapid move of companies toward digital marketing and communications efforts, and the coming world of connected devices in the Internet of Things. As improper use or inadequate protection of the data can result in civil or even criminal penalties to both companies and executives, it is imperative that marketing professionals understand the technology that underlies the digital data landscape, and further understand the legal and regulatory environment within which they are operating when using the data for marketing and other business purposes. \n\n \n\nThe first half of the course will focus on the data ecosystem and privacy. Here, the class will explore the technology underlying data tracking, collection, aggregation and use.  Further, the course will examine data brokers/aggregators and their role in the communications development chain. Finally, the course will cover the legal and regulatory perspective toward the industry's privacy-related behavior and practices in the development of marketing communications. \n\n \n\nThe second half of the course will focus on data security. Given the number of continuing breaches, many at large, high profile companies, the class will look at statutes and regulations covering data security within a number of industries, and those that might be most relevant to media organizations. The course will wrap up with a look at professional opportunities in the emerging privacy \"industry,\" and at industry certification for those who might be interested.",

Through rigorous physical training, the Viewpoints cultivate a kinesthetic connection to given circumstances, impulse, intention, and action. The course follows a progression from non-verbal improvisations, to group and solo compositions, and text work.

For some, it is the truest expression of Jewish sovereignty.  For others, Zionism has been derided as colonialism and racism.  Yet, what is Zionism? (Or more accurately, is there such thing as one monolithic \"Zionism\"?) And who and what have been its historical proponents and opponents?  \nThe first half of the course focuses on the pre-1948 period, considering classical Zionist thought (selected from different streams of Zionist ideology) such as political Zionism (Herzl), cultural Zionism (Ahad Ha-am), revisionist Zionism (Jabotinsky), and binationalism (Buber), as well as dissent both within and outside the pre-state community in Palestine, including the incipient Palestinian national movement.  Particular attention will be paid to themes such as the \"Rejection of the Diaspora\" and the \"Creation of the New Jew,\" the \"Arab Question,\" and the religious/secular divide.  \nThe second half of the course will examine the evolution of Zionist thought in the post 1948 period, revisiting some old debates as well as new developments on left and right like the Caananite movement, the Israeli settler movement, the Israeli Black Panther party, and critiques from women, post-Zionists, and the Jewish-American diaspora.  The course will also highlight the growth of external opponents to Zionism amongst the Palestinians (secular and religious), the Arab world, and the international community.

The Progressive Writer's Movement was a broad and influential effort to bring about social and economic equality and an end to colonialism and imperialism through socially-conscious art. Its wane in the 1940s and 50s was followed by an ongoing period of fragmentation typified by a broad range of styles, the adoption of new literary forms and the adaptation of old ones. This post-Progressive period remains the least studied in Hindi-Urdu literature. In this class, we will study major movements, authors and themes from the independence era to the present day. Students may expect to learn about the history of modern Hindi and Urdu literature and become familiar with influential authors and new critical approaches to their study.

    "overview": "In 1945, Germany was in ruins. The defeat of the Nazis had physically destroyed Germany's infrastructure, morally delegitimized its institutions, and politically divided its territory between a capitalist West and a socialist East. The German-German border, most vividly symbolized by the Berlin Wall, became one of the defining sites of the Cold War. This course examines the formation of two separate German states and the solutions that they developed to the common challenge of turning Nazis back into citizens, rebuilding a devastated economy, remembering Nazi crimes, and navigating between the two American and Soviet superpowers. The course also explores how these two different societies responded to terrorism, environmental degradation, and immigration and asylum seekers. Finally, we will analyze the reunification of the two German states after 1989 and the challenges that continue to confront Germany today. How is it that this ruined land of 1945 could become, within fifty years, the wealthiest and most stable nation in Europe?",

We now have several decades' worth of research from the social sciences and humanities showing that so-called \"natural\" disasters are not very natural at all. Instead, they are deeply political and profoundly man-made. This course adopts a historical and global approach in order to denaturalize disaster. From famines in British India to earthquakes in post-colonial Peru, from floods in New Orleans to nuclear disaster in Japan, we will see how disasters expose and exacerbate pre-existing inequalities, inflicting suffering disproportionately among those groups already marginalized by race, class, gender, geography, and age. These inequalities shape not only the impact of the disaster but the range of responses to it, including political critique and retrenchment, relief and rebuilding efforts, memorialization, and planning - or failing to plan - for future disasters of a similar kind. The course culminates in a unit on the contemporary challenge of anthropogenic global climate change, the ultimate man-made disaster. We will consider how memories, fears, and fantasies of past disasters are being repurposed to create new visions of what climate change will look like.",

Thus, in class exercises, monologues, and partnered scenes, they explore using gravity-directed relaxation as a way to calm body and mind - so that both body and mind can work with power, intensity, and without strain.\n\nToward this goal, students learn about human anatomy and how human evolution has designed the body and voice to work - efficiently, in accordance with nature's laws.  They also become aware of how the mind, when detached from nature's wisdom, can create physical habits that make the body and voice work inefficiently, which can lead to injury. \n \nBy grounding all stage expression in gravity-directed, anatomical reality, SDS for Actors makes partners of science and art, of fact and imagination.  The goal:  helping actors play scenes with grounded truthfulness, hot-blooded sensuousness, and, not less, joy.",

Instead, they locate its origin in the ambiguous experience of what is familiar and \"homey\". Both Heidegger and Freud find this experience articulated most intensively in literature: Heidegger in Sophocles' Antigone, and Freud in E.T. A. Hoffmann's short story, \"The Sandman.\" In addition to studying these texts, we will also look at one or two short texts by Kafka, as well as a more recent instance of the Uncanny in a different medium, film, namely in \"A Serious Man\" by the Coen Brothers. Their technique of the \"double take,\" as opposed to \"slapstick,\" reveals the close connection between anxiety and laughter, between the Uncanny and humor. \n\nThe class will consist of lectures and discussion, involving short student reports and a longer 15-page term paper.",

This course provides an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of Native American Studies, focusing on indigenous peoples north of Mexico, their traditional cultures, histories, and their present day status and conditions.  \n\nWe will begin with a survey of the culture areas of North America, including adaptations to the natural environment, interactions among the various tribes, reactions to European invasion, and colonization.  We will also discuss historical kinship systems, social structures, economic and political institutions, religion and ideology.\n\nThe second half of the course examines how the modern structure of Native societies is a product of these historical trajectories as well as interactions with broader American institutions.  Students will become familiar with the economic, political and legal structures of modern Native tribes, as well as the current economic and social experiences of Indians.  Students will gain an understanding of sociological theory through an examination of Native America, as both a unique environment and as a representative case study of the inequality processes.",

It has been argued we are in a new era of technology-enhanced innovation at this particular time, explaining disruptive changes in industries and consumer behavior changes at high velocity. These changes have come, in great measure, through what Clayton Christiansen characterizes as \"disruptive innovation,\" due to small companies and start-ups leapfrogging legacy leaders.\n\nPrerequisite: IMC 420\n\n\n \n\nAdditionally, much of the media attention, and arguably investment, has been around new entrepreneurial enterprises and new start-ups.\n\n \n\nWhat about large, legacy organizations that have been leaders in their industries? How do they innovate to sustain their leadership? How do they leverage their advantages? Are the strategies to do so similar or different from smaller start-ups?\n\n \n\nLearning Goals\n\nBy the end of the course, students will be equipped to answer a diverse set of International Enterprise IMC Innovation-related questions, supporting their answers with examples, where appropriate:\n\n \n\n    How does innovation happen in large enterprises, with international footprints? Additionally, what are the unique innovation characteristics for these types of businesses?\n    How do organizations process and manage transformational challenges faced by the enterprise in marketing, media, and communications, in particular?\n    What does sustainable innovation look like as compared to disruptive innovation, and what are examples of each?\n    What are the strategies to be a successful \"intrapreneur\"?",

Indeed, an intellectual tradition stretching from Ancient Greek philosophers to present-day scientists proposes that language is essentially what makes us human. This class will examine the fundamental question: What is language's role in cognition? Drawing on research from psychology, as well as cognitive science, linguistics, and occasionally neuroscience and animal cognition, we will ask questions like whether our language changes the way we perceive the world (e.g., the way we see colors), how language helps infants and children develop, and what role language plays in defining our abstract concepts (e.g., time). We will review both seminal and cutting-edge research concerning when, if ever, the language(s) we speak influence how we perceive, reason, and act on the world. The goal of the course is not simply to survey research in these areas, but rather to explore alternative theories of language's role and to describe the evidence that supports or challenges them.

    "overview": "The occurrence of natural genetic variation is the raw material with which evolution has sculped every organism that ever existed.  Among these organisms are the fungi.  In this laboratory-based course, students will be immersed into the world of a famous mushroom-forming fungus, Schizophyllum commune.  In the wild, Schizophyllum helps to ensure that we are not up to our necks in dead plant material by breaking down the lignin and cellulose present in wood.  In the lab, this organism has served as a model eukaryote to study basic principles genetics and development for over 80 years.  Recent genomic studies have revealed that Schizophyllum harbors far more genetic variation than any other eukaryotic organism.  In addition, because of the genetic variation at the two genetic loci that control mating, it is estimated that there are over 23,000 \"sexes\" in this fungus!  \nIn this course, students will learn key aspects of the biology of Schizophyllum (and several other fungi) and will carry out experiments to examine the extraordinary natural genetic variation that this organism has undergone.  Every experiment will be designed to discover new knowledge.  Each student will be provided with specimens from a nation-wide collection of wild S. commune specimens with which to carry out molecular, genetic, and genomic experiments and analyses.  Each student will also analyze Schizophyllum specimens that she/he has found in the local environment.   \nWorking with Professor Gaber, students will generate new mutations, determine the molecular sequences of the genes that control mushroom mating, and perform molecular \"barcoding\" to establish phylogenetic relationships between members of the Schizophyllum population.  They will also screen a nation-wide collection of Schizophyllum to investigate the genetic and phenotypic variation exhibited by this organism.",
